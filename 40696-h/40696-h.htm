<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="indent">The Crown Prince is partly right; the majority in the
world is against him and what he stands for; but not against
Germany and the Germans.</p>

<p class="indent">He professes surprise at the attitude of the United States.
That attitude is the natural result of various causes among
which are the following:</p>

<p class="indent">Distrust of any aggressor by a nation inclined toward
peace.</p>

<p class="indent">Disgust at the "scrap of paper" episode.</p>

<p class="indent">Resentment at the invasion of Belgium.</p>

<p class="indent">Contempt for the Imperial Government which is industriously
screwing the last penny of "indemnity" out of a
ruined nation, which the people of the United States are
taxing their private means to keep from starvation.</p>

<p class="indent">Further back there are other reasons.</p>

<p class="indent">For thirty years the press of Germany has seldom missed
an opportunity to express its contempt for Americans. Any
American who has ever lived in Germany or who has read
German newspapers during the last thirty years is aware
of the tone of the German press concerning America and
Americans. No innuendoes have been too vulgar, no sneers
too brutal for the editors of these papers, and, presumably
for the readers.</p>

<p class="indent">Also Americans do not forget the attitude of the Imperial
Government during the Spanish war. The bad manners of
a German Admiral are bearing fruit.</p>

<p class="indent">Imperialism we Americans do not understand, but it
need not make us unfriendly to empires.</p>

<p class="indent">But we do understand when manners are bad, or when
a military caste, which maintains its traditions of personal
honour by violence, becomes arrogant to the point of
brutality.</p>

<p class="indent">A false notion of personal honour is alone enough to prevent
a sympathetic understanding between two peoples.</p>

<p class="indent">America is not an enemy to Germany, only is it inexorably
opposed to any Government which breaks faith;
and which enthrones above all other gods the god of
violence.</p>

<p class="indent">For the German soldiers who are dying in this Hohenzollern-Hapsburg
war we have only sympathy and pity.
We know they are as brave as any soldiers; that cruelty in
the German Army is in no greater proportion than it is in
any army.</p>

<p class="indent">But also we know that the cause of Imperial Germany is
wrong; her civilization is founded on propositions impossible
for any American to accept; her aims, ambitions, and
ideals antagonistic to the progress to communal and individual
liberty as we understand the terms. And that settles
the matter for us.</p>

<h1>WHO GOES THERE!</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>IN THE MIST</h3>

<p class="indent">They had selected for their business the outer
face of an old garden wall. There were red
tiles on the coping; dusty roadside vines half
covered the base. Where plaster had peeled off a few
weather-beaten bricks showed. Bees hummed in the
trampled herbage.</p>

<p class="indent">Against this wall they backed the first six men. One,
a mere boy, was crying, wiping his frightened eyes on
his shirt-sleeve.</p>

<p class="indent">The dry crash of the volley ended the matter; all the
men against the wall collapsed. Presently one of them,
the boy who had been crying, moved his arm in the grass.
A rifle spoke instantly, and he moved no more.</p>

<p class="indent">There came a low-spoken word of command, the firing
squad shouldered rifles, wheeled, and moved off;
and out of the sea-grey masses of infantry another
squad of execution came marching up, smartly.</p>

<p class="indent">A dozen men, some in sabots, trousers, and dirty collarless
shirts, some in well-cut business suits and straw
hats, and all with their wrists tied behind them, stood
silently awaiting their turns. One among them, a young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
man wearing a golf-cap, knickerbockers, heather-spats,
and an absolutely colourless face, stood staring at the
tumbled heaps of clothing along the foot of the wall as
though stupified.</p>

<p class="indent">Six peasants went first; the men more smartly attired
were to wait a little longer it appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">The emotionless and methodical preparations, the
brisk precision of the operation, the cheerful celerity
of the firing squad made it the more terrifying, stunning
the victims to immobility.</p>

<p class="indent">The young man in the golf-cap and knickerbockers
clenched his tied hands. Not an atom of colour remained
in cheeks or lips, and he stood with face averted
while the squad of execution was busy with its business.</p>

<p class="indent">There seemed to be some slight disorder along the
wall&mdash;a defiant voice was raised hoarsely cursing all
Germans; another, thin and hysterical, cheered for Belgium
and the young King. Also this firing squad must
have aimed badly, for bayonet and rifle-butt were used
afterward and some delay occurred; and an officer, revolver
swinging, prowled along the foot of the wall,
kicking inquiringly at the dead heaps of heavy flesh
that had collapsed there.</p>

<p class="indent">Houses lining the single village street began to leak
smoke; smoke writhed and curled behind closed window-panes.
Here and there a mounted Uhlan forced his big
horse up on the sidewalk and drove his lance butt
through the window glass.</p>

<p class="indent">Already the street was swimming in thin strata of
smoke; the sea-grey uniforms of the German infantry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
seemed part of the haze; only the faces of the soldiery
were visible&mdash;faces without bodies, thousands of flat,
detached faces, thousands of little pig eyes set in a
blank and foggy void. And over everything in the
close, heavy air brooded the sour stench of a sweat-soaked,
unwashed army.</p>

<p class="indent">A third squad of execution came swinging up, apparently
out of nowhere, their heavy half-boots clumping
in unison on the stony street.</p>

<p class="indent">The young man in the golf-cap and knickerbockers
heard them coming and bit his bloodless lip.</p>

<p class="indent">After a moment the rhythm of the heavy boots ceased.
The street became very silent, save where window glass
continually fell tinkling to the sidewalk and the feathery
whisper of flames became more audible from within
the row of empty houses.</p>

<p class="indent">The young man lifted his eyes to the sombre and sunless
sky. High up there above the mist and heavy
bands of smoke he saw the feathery tops of tall trees,
motionless.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently through the silence came the clatter of
hoofs; Uhlans cantered past, pennons whipping from
lance heads; then a soft two-toned bugle-call announced
an automobile; and presently it loomed up,
huge, through the parted ranks of the infantry, a
great grey, low-purring bulk, slowing, halting, still
purring.</p>

<p class="indent">A grey-clad general officer sat in the tonneau, a
grey-uniformed hussar was seated beside the grey-liveried
chauffeur.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
As the car stopped several officers were already beside
the running-board, halted stiffly at attention. The
general officer, his cigar between his gloved fingers,
leaned over the edge of the tonneau and said something
in a very quiet voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Instantly a slim, stiff infantry captain saluted,
wheeled sharply, and walked straight to the little file
of prisoners who stood with their wrists tied behind
their backs, looking vacantly at the automobile.</p>

<p class="indent">"Which is the prisoner-hostage who says he is American?"
he snapped out in his nasal Prussian voice.</p>

<p class="indent">The young man who wore a golf-cap took a short
step forward, hesitated.</p>

<p class="indent">"You?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Fall in again!"</p>

<p class="indent">The officer nodded to a sergeant of infantry, and a
squad of men shoved the prisoners into single file, facing
not the fatal wall, but westward, along the street.</p>

<p class="indent">"March!" said somebody. And the next moment
again: "Halt!" rang out with the snapping brevity of
a cracked whip. The general officer leaned from the
grey tonneau and looked steadily along the file of
hostages until his glance fell upon the young man in
the golf-cap.</p>

<p class="indent">"What is your name?" he asked quietly in English.</p>

<p class="indent">"My name is Guild."</p>

<p class="indent">"The rest?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn Guild."</p>

<p class="indent">"You say you are American?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">The general officer looked at him for a moment
longer, then said something to the hussar aide-de-camp.</p>

<p class="indent">The aide threw open the car door and jumped out.
A lieutenant took command of the escort. The hussar
whispered instructions, turned and came to attention
beside the running-board, then, at a nod from the general
officer, jumped up beside the chauffeur. There
came the soft-toned, mellow warning of the bugle; the
grey machine glided off into the mist; the prisoners
and escort followed it, marching briskly.</p>

<p class="indent">As they passed the end of the street two houses on
their right suddenly roared up in one vast, smoke-shot
tower of flame, and a brassy glare lighted up the mist
around them.</p>

<p class="indent">Somewhere near by a woman began to scream; farther
down the street, more windows and doors were
being beaten in. From farther away, still, came the
strains of military music, resonant, full, magnificent.
A detail passed with spades to bury the dead who lay
under the wall. All was order, precision, and cheerful
despatch. The infantry column, along the halted flanks
of which the prisoners were now being marched, came
to attention. Company after company marked time,
heavily; shouldered rifles. Uhlans in file came spurring
through the centre of the street; a cyclist followed, rifle
slung across his back, sitting at ease on his machine
and gazing curiously about.</p>

<p class="indent">Out of the end of the village street marched the prisoners
and their escort, but presently halted again.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
Directly in front of them stood the grey automobile
drawn up by the roadside before a pair of iron gates.
The gates swung from high stucco walls. On top of
the walls were soldiers sitting, rifle on knee; a machine
gun commanded the drive, and across the gravel more
soldiers were digging a trench, setting posts, and stringing
barbed wire which they unwound from great wooden
reels.</p>

<p class="indent">Through the gates escort and prisoners threaded
their way, across a lawn already trampled by cavalry,
and straight on toward a pleasant looking and somewhat
old-fashioned house set amid older trees and shrubbery,
badly broken.</p>

<p class="indent">Half a dozen grey-clad staff officers were eating and
drinking on the low stone terrace; their horses picketed
on the lawn, nibbled the crushed shrubbery. Sentries
pacing the terrace and on guard at the door came to
attention as the lieutenant in charge of the escort
marched his prisoners in.</p>

<p class="indent">At a word from him an infantryman went from prisoner
to prisoner untying the cords that bound their
wrists behind them. Then they were marched into an
old-fashioned drawing-room on the left, sentries were
placed, the remainder of the escort sat down on the
floor with their loaded rifles on their laps and their
backs against the wall. Their officer, the lieutenant,
walked across the hallway to the room on the left,
where the sentry admitted him, then closed the door
and resumed his heavy pacing of the black-tiled hall.</p>

<p class="indent">The sergeant in charge of the escort lifted his helmet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
with its grey-cloth covering, scratched his bullet head,
yawned. Then he said, jerking a huge thumb toward
the drawing-room: "There&#39;s a good wall in the garden
behind the house. They&#39;ll make the fruit grow all the
better&mdash;these Belgians."</p>

<p class="indent">The lieutenant, coming out of the room opposite,
overheard him.</p>

<p class="indent">"What your crops need," he said in a mincing Berlin
voice, "is plenty of good English filth to spade under.
See that you bring in a few cart-loads."</p>

<p class="indent">And he went into the drawing-room where the prisoners
stood by the windows looking out silently at a
great pall of smoke which was hanging over the village
through which they had just been marched.</p>

<p class="indent">"Which of you is the alleged American?" said the
lieutenant in hesitating but correct English.</p>

<p class="indent">The young man in knickerbockers rose from a brocaded
armchair.</p>

<p class="indent">"Follow me. General von Reiter does you the honour
to question you."</p>

<p class="indent">The young man looked the lieutenant straight in
the eye and smiled, stiffly perhaps, because his face
was still pallid and the breath of death still
chilled it.</p>

<p class="indent">"The honour," he said in an agreeably modulated
voice, "is General von Reiter&#39;s. But I fear he won&#39;t
realize it."</p>

<p class="indent">"What&#39;s that!" said the lieutenant sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">But young Guild shrugged his shoulders. "You
wouldn&#39;t understand either. Besides you are too talkative for an underling. Do your duty&mdash;if you know
how."</p>

<p class="indent">"Swine of a Yankee," said the lieutenant, speaking
slowly and with painful precision, "do you suppose you
are in your own sty of a Republic? Silence! A Prussian
officer commands you! March!"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild dropped his hands into the pockets of his
belted jacket. "You little shrimp," he said good humouredly,
and followed the officer, who had now drawn
his sword.</p>

<p class="indent">Out into the hall they filed, across it to the closed
door. The sentry on duty there opened it; the lieutenant,
very red in the face, delivered his prisoner,
then, at a nod from the grey-clad officer who was sitting
behind a writing desk, saluted, faced about, and
marched out. The door closed sharply behind him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE MAN IN GREY</h3>

<p class="indent">Young Guild looked steadily at the man in grey,
and the man in grey gazed as steadily back
from behind his desk.</p>

<p class="indent">He was a man of forty-five, lean, well built, blond,
and of regular features save that his cheek-bones were
a trifle high, which seemed to crowd his light blue eyes,
make them narrower, and push them into a very slight
slant. He had the well-groomed aspect of a Prussian
officer, dry of skin, clean-shaven save for the mustache
<i>en croc</i>, which his bony but powerful and well-kept
hands absently caressed at intervals.</p>

<p class="indent">His forehead was broad and benevolent, but his eyes
modified the humanity and his mouth almost denied it&mdash;a
mouth firm without shrewdness, not bad, not cruel
for the sake of cruelty, yet moulded in lines which
promised no hope other than that iron justice which
knows no mercy.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Guild?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, General."</p>

<p class="indent">General von Reiter folded his bony hands and rested
them on the blotter.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
"You say that you are American?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"How came you to be among the Yslemont hostages?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I was stopping at the Hotel Poste when the Uhlans
and cyclists suddenly appeared. The captain of Uhlans
took the Burgomaster with whom I had been playing
chess, myself, the notary, and other leading citizens."</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you tell him you are American?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. But he paid no attention."</p>

<p class="indent">"Had you a passport?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Other papers to establish your identity?"</p>

<p class="indent">"A few business letters from New York. They read
them, but told me they were of no use to me."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why did you not communicate with your nearest
Consul or with the American Minister in Brussels?"</p>

<p class="indent">"They refused me the use of telephone and telegraph.
They said that I am Belgian and properly liable to be
taken as hostage for the good behaviour of Yslemont."</p>

<p class="indent">General von Reiter&#39;s hand was lifted meditatively to
his mustache. He said: "What happened after you
were refused permission to communicate with the American
representatives?"</p>

<p class="indent">"We were all in the dining-room of the Hotel Poste
under guard. At the Burgomaster&#39;s dictation I was
writing out a proclamation warning the inhabitants of
Yslemont not to commit any act of violence against the
German soldiery and explaining that we were held as
hostages for their good behaviour and that a shot fired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
at a German meant a dead wall and a squad of execution
for us and the destruction of Yslemont for them&mdash;"
He flushed, hesitated.</p>

<p class="indent">"Continue," said the general.</p>

<p class="indent">"While I was still writing the shots were fired. We
all went to the window and we saw Uhlans galloping
across the fields after some peasants who were running
into the woods. Afterward two stretchers came by with
Germans lying in them. After that an officer came and
cursed us and the soldiers tied our hands behind our
backs. We sat there in the dining-room until the
Uhlans came riding into the street with their prisoners
tied by ropes to their saddles. Then a major of infantry
came into the dining-room and read our sentence
to us. Then they marched us out into the fog."</p>

<p class="indent">The general crossed his spurred boots under the
desk and lay back in his chair, looking at Guild all
the while.</p>

<p class="indent">"So you are American, Mr. Guild?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, General."</p>

<p class="indent">"In business in New York?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"What business?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Real estate."</p>

<p class="indent">"Where?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Union Square, West."</p>

<p class="indent">"What is the name of the firm in which you are
associated?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Guild and Darrel."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is that your partner&#39;s name?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
"Yes. Henry Darrel."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why are you here in Belgium?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I was making a foot tour in the Ardennes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Your business vacation?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. I was to meet my partner in Luxembourg
and return to New York with him."</p>

<p class="indent">"You and your partner are both absent from New
York at the same time?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"How is that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Real estate in New York is quiet. There is practically
no business now."</p>

<p class="indent">The general nodded. "Yes," he said, "much of what
you tell me has been corroborated. In the Seegard
Regiment of Infantry Number 569 you were recognized
by several non-commissioned officers and men while you
stood with the hostages awaiting&mdash;ah&mdash;justice," he
added drily.</p>

<p class="indent">"Recognized?" repeated Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"The soldiers who recognized you had served in New
York hotels as clerks or waiters, I believe. The captain
of that company, in consequence, very properly
reported the matter to Colonel von Eschbach, who
telephoned to me. And I am here to consider the
matter."</p>

<p class="indent">Then, folding his arms and looking hard at Guild
out of narrowing eyes that began to slant again:</p>

<p class="indent">"The hostages of Yslemont have justly forfeited
their lives. Two of my officers have been murdered
there in the streets. The law is plain. Is there any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
reason why these hostages should not pay the proper
penalty?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The Burgomaster was in the act of dictating&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"He should have dictated faster!"</p>

<p class="indent">"These gentlemen did not fire the shots&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"But those over whom they exercised authority
did!"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild fell silent and his features paled a little. The
general watched him in silence for a moment and an
inquiring expression came into his narrow eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well?" he said at length.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild lifted his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, sir," repeated the general. "I have said that
there is no reason why the hostages taken at Yslemont
should not be turned over to the squad of execution
outside there in the hallway."</p>

<p class="indent">"I heard you say it."</p>

<p class="indent">The general looked at him curiously. "You have
nothing to say?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not for yourself?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"As a matter of fact, Mr. Guild, what was your ultimate
object in passing through Yslemont?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have already told you that I had intended to make
a foot tour through the Three Ardennes."</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Had</i> intended?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Was that still your intention when you were made
prisoner?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
After a moment&#39;s hesitation: "No," said Guild in a
low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"You altered your plan?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"You decided to employ your vacation otherwise?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"How?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I decided to enlist," said Guild. He was very
white, now.</p>

<p class="indent">"Enlist?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"In the British army?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The Belgian."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! So now you do not remind me that, as an
American, you claim exemption from the execution of
the sentence?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have said enough," replied Guild. A slight colour
showed over his cheek-bones.</p>

<p class="indent">"If I shoot the Burgomaster and the notary and the
others in there, ought I to let you go&mdash;on your own
representations?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have said enough," repeated Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! So you refuse to plead any particular exemption
on account of your nationality?"</p>

<p class="indent">No answer.</p>

<p class="indent">"And you, by your silence, permit yourself to
be implicated in the responsibility of your fellow-hostages?"</p>

<p class="indent">No reply.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?&mdash;Mr. Guild. Is it, perhaps, after all because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
you are not an American in the strictest sense
of that often misused term?"</p>

<p class="indent">There was no response.</p>

<p class="indent">"You were born in America?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Your father, perhaps, was born there?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! And <i>his</i> father?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! You are, I see, quite candid, Mr. Guild."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, when necessary."</p>

<p class="indent">"I see. Very well, then. Where do you get your
Christian name, Kervyn? Is it an American name?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"The name, Guild&mdash;is that an American name?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"But&mdash;<i>is</i> it <i>your</i> name?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Was it, by chance, ever spelled a little differently&mdash;in
times gone by, Mr. Guild?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! And how, in times gone by, was it spelled by
your&mdash;grandfather?"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild looked him calmly in the eyes. "It was spelled
Gueldres," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"I see, I see. That <i>is</i> interesting. Gueldres, Kervyn
Gueldres. Why, it sounds almost Belgian. Let me
see&mdash;if I remember&mdash;there was such a family inscribed
in the Book of Gold. There was even a Kervyn of
Gueldres&mdash;a count, was he not?&mdash;Comte d&#39;Yvoir&mdash;Count
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
of Yvoir, Hastière, and Lesse. Was he not&mdash;this
Kervyn of Gueldres, many, many years ago?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I congratulate General von Reiter on his memory
for such unimportant history as that of Belgium," said
Guild, reddening.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, we Germans are studious in our youth&mdash;and
thorough. Nothing is too unimportant to ignore and"&mdash;he
smiled grimly&mdash;"nothing is too vast for us to
undertake&mdash;and accomplish."</p>

<p class="indent">He lifted his hand to his mustache again. "Mr.
Guild," he said, "at the elections in America you&mdash;ah&mdash;vote
of course?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"What?"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild remained silent.</p>

<p class="indent">The general, stroking his mustache, said pleasantly:
"The Belgian nobility always interested me; it is so
exclusive and there are so few families of the <i>classe
noble</i>. Except for those ten families who are independent
of Court favour&mdash;like the Croys and De Lignes&mdash;there
seem to be only about thirty families who possess
the privileges of the Golden Book. Is this not so?"</p>

<p class="indent">"General von Reiter appears to know."</p>

<p class="indent">The general seemed gratified at this corroboration of
his own memory. "And," he went on amiably, "this
Belgian nobility is a real nobility. Once of it, always
a part of it. And, too, its code is so rigid, so inexorably
precise that it seems almost Prussian. For example,
the code of the Belgian aristocracy permits none
of its members to go into any commercial business, any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
trade&mdash;even forbids an entry into high finance. Only
the Church and Army are open to it; and in the Army
only the two Guides regiments and the Lancers are
permitted to young men of the aristocracy." He gazed
almost mildly at the young man: "You are in business,
you tell me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! Then of course you have never been a soldier."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild was silent.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Have</i> you ever served in the army?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Really! In what American regiment have you
served?"</p>

<p class="indent">"In a militia regiment of cavalry&mdash;the 1st New
York."</p>

<p class="indent">"How interesting. And&mdash;you have never served in
the regular army?"</p>

<p class="indent">"N&mdash;" but Guild hesitated.</p>

<p class="indent">General von Reiter watched him intently.</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you reply in the negative, Mr. Guild?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I did not reply at all."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! Then would you be good enough to reply?"</p>

<p class="indent">"If&mdash;you insist."</p>

<p class="indent">"I insist."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well," said Guild, reddening, "then I have
served in the&mdash;Belgian army."</p>

<p class="indent">The general nodded without surprise: "In what
regiment?"</p>

<p class="indent">"In the first regiment of Guides."</p>

<p class="indent">"You came from America to do this?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"When?"</p>

<p class="indent">"When I became of military age."</p>

<p class="indent">"Noblesse oblige?"</p>

<p class="indent">No reply.</p>

<p class="indent">"In other words, you are an American with all the
Belgian aristocracy&#39;s sense of responsibility to race and
tradition. You are a good American, but there are
inherited instincts which sent you back to serve two
years with the colours&mdash;to serve a country which for
ten hundred years your race has defended. And&mdash;the
Guides alone was open to a Gueldres&mdash;where, in America,
a Guild was free to choose. Monsieur, you are
Belgian; and, as a Belgian, you were properly seized
as a hostage and properly sentenced to pay the penalty
for the murderous misbehaviour of your own people!
I approve the sentence. Have you anything to say?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">The general regarded him closely, then rose, came
around the end of the desk, walked across the room and
halted directly in front of Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"So you see there is no chance for you," he said,
staring hard at him.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild managed to control his voice and speak clearly:
"I see," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Suppose," said von Reiter, still staring at him, "I
ask you to do me a favour?"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild&#39;s face was marble, but he managed to force a
smile: "You ask a favour of a prisoner a few moments
before his execution?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
"I do. Will you grant it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What is it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing dishonourable to a good&mdash;American."</p>

<p class="indent">"That is not enough; and you know it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well. I shall tell you then. I have a daughter
in England. I can&#39;t get her away from England&mdash;I
can&#39;t get word to her. I&mdash;" suddenly his dry, blond
features twitched, but instantly the man had them under
iron control again, and he cleared his throat: "She is
in England near London. We are at war with England.
I want my daughter out of the country. I can&#39;t
get her out. Go and get her for me!"</p>

<p class="indent">For a full minute the two men gazed at each other
in silence. Then von Reiter said: "I know enough of
you. If you say you&#39;ll do it I&#39;ll free the Burgomaster
and the others in there&mdash;" he jerked his bony thumb
toward the hallway outside&mdash;"If you say you&#39;ll do
it&mdash;if you say you&#39;ll go to England, now, and find my
daughter, and bring her here to me&mdash;or conduct her
to whatever point I designate, I&#39;ll not have those men
shot; I&#39;ll not burn the rest of Yslemont; I&#39;ll see that
you are conducted to the Dutch frontier unmolested
after you carry out your engagements with me. Will
you do it?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 516px;">
<a name="gs02" id="gs02"></a><img class="border" src="images/gs02.png" width="516" height="700" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">"&#39;If you say you&#39;ll do it, ... I&#39;ll not have those men
shot&#39;"</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Guild met his intent gaze with a gaze as searching:</p>

<p class="indent">"What is your daughter&#39;s name?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Her name is Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">"Where am I to find her?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Thirty miles out of London at Westheath. She is
known there as Karen Girard."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
"What!" said Guild sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">"She chose to be so known in her profession."</p>

<p class="indent">"Her profession?"</p>

<p class="indent">"She has been on the stage&mdash;against my wishes. She
is preparing herself further&mdash;contrary to my wishes.
Until she disassociates herself from that profession she
will not use the name of von Reiter."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild nodded slowly: "<i>That</i> is why your daughter is
known as Karen Girard?"</p>

<p class="indent">"That is why. She is a young girl&mdash;nineteen. She
went to school in her mother&#39;s country, Denmark. She
imbibed notions there&mdash;and, later, in England among
art students and others. It is the well-born who succumb
most easily to nonsense once the discipline is relaxed.
She has had her way in spite of my authority.
Now it is time for such insubordination to cease. I
wish to have my daughter back. I cannot get her.
You are&mdash;American&mdash;to all intents and purposes, and
you would be under no suspicion in England. Your
appearance, your speech, your manners all are above
suspicion. You <i>can</i> do this. I have made up my mind
concerning you, and I trust you. Will you go to England,
find my daughter and bring her back to me here;
or, if I am ordered elsewhere, will you escort her to my
country place in Silesia which is called Rehthal?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Suppose I do not find her? Suppose I fail?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You will return here and report to me."</p>

<p class="indent">"If I fail and I return here and report my failure,
does that mean the execution of the gentlemen in the
drawing-room yonder?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
"It does."</p>

<p class="indent">"And the destruction of Yslemont?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Absolutely."</p>

<p class="indent">"And&mdash;" the young man smiled&mdash;"incidentally it
means my own execution, does it not?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It does."</p>

<p class="indent">They gazed at each other with intense interest.</p>

<p class="indent">"Under such circumstances do you think I&#39;ll come
back if I am not successful?" inquired the younger man.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am satisfied that you will return if you say you
will."</p>

<p class="indent">"Return to face my own execution?" repeated Guild,
curiously. "You believe that of me?&mdash;of a man about
whom you know nothing&mdash;a man who"&mdash;his animated
features suddenly darkened and he caught his breath a
moment, then&mdash;"a man who considers your nation a
barbarous one, your rulers barbarians, your war inexcusable,
your invasion of this land the vilest example of
treachery and dishonour that the world has ever witnessed&mdash;you
still believe that such a man might consider
himself bound to return here if unsuccessful and
face one of your murdering platoons? <i>Do</i> you?" he
repeated, the slightest intonation of violence beginning
to ring in the undertones of his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Von Reiter&#39;s dry, blond features had become greyer
and more set. His light blue eyes never left the other;
behind their pale, steady scrutiny he seemed to be considering
every word.</p>

<p class="indent">He drew in his breath, slowly; his very thin lips receded
for a moment, then the fixed tranquillity returned.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
"We Germans," he said drily, "care nothing for what
Europe may think of us or say about us. Perhaps we
are vandals, Goths, Huns&mdash;whatever you call them.
Perhaps we are barbarians. I think we <i>are</i>! For we
mean to scour the old world clean of its rottenness&mdash;cauterize
it, cut out the old sores of a worn-out civilization,
scrape its surface clean of the parasite nations.
... And, if <i>fire</i> be necessary to burn out the last
traces&mdash;" His light blue eyes glimmered a very reflection
of the word&mdash;"then let fire pass. It has passed,
before&mdash;God&#39;s Angel of the Flaming Sword has returned
again to lead us! What is a cathedral or two&mdash;or
pictures or foolish statues&mdash;or a million lives? Yes,
if you choose, we are barbarians. And we intend to
plow under the accumulated decay of the whole world,
and burn up its rubbish and found our new world on
virgin earth. Yes, we <i>are</i> barbarians. And our Emperor
is a barbarian. And God, who creates with one
hand and destroys with the other&mdash;God&mdash;autocrat of
material creation, inexorable Over-Lord of ultimate
material annihilation, is the greatest barbarian of all!
Under His orders we are moving. In His name we
annihilate! Amen!"</p>

<p class="indent">A dead silence ensued. And after it had lasted a
little while the tall Prussian lifted his hand absently to
his mustache and touched it caressingly.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am satisfied, whatever your opinion may be of me
or of my people, that you will return if you say you
will, successful or otherwise. I promise you immunity
if you return with my daughter; I promise you a wall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
and a file of men if you return unsuccessful. But, in
either event, I am satisfied that you will return. Will
you go?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," said Guild, thoughtfully. They stood for a
moment longer, the young man gazing absently out of
the window toward the menacing smoke pall which was
increasing above Yslemont.</p>

<p class="indent">"You promise not to burn the remainder of the village?"
he asked, turning to look at von Reiter.</p>

<p class="indent">"I promise not to burn it if you keep your promise."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll try.... And the Burgomaster, notary, magistrate,
and the others are to be released?"</p>

<p class="indent">"If you do what I ask."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well. It&#39;s worth trying for. Give me my
credentials."</p>

<p class="indent">"You need no written ones. Letters are unsafe. You
will go to my daughter, who has leased a small cottage
at Westheath. You will say to her that you come from
me; that <i>the question which she was to decide on the
first of November must be decided sooner</i>, and that
when she arrives at Rehthal in Silesia she is to telegraph
me through the General Staff of her arrival. If
I can obtain leave to go to Silesia I shall do so. If
not, I shall telegraph my instructions to her."</p>

<p class="indent">"Will that be sufficient for your daughter to place
her confidence in a man absolutely strange to her and
accompany that man on a journey of several days?"
asked Guild, slightly astonished.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not quite sufficient," said von Reiter, his dry, blond
visage slightly relaxing.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
He drew a rather plain ring from his bony finger:
"See if you can wear that," he said. "Does it fit you?"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild tried it on. "Well enough."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is there any danger of its slipping off?"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild tried it on another finger, which it fitted
snugly.</p>

<p class="indent">"It looks like any other plain gold ring," he remarked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Her name is engraved inside."</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">There came a short pause. Then: "Do you know
London?" asked von Reiter.</p>

<p class="indent">"Passably."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! You are likely to require a touring car.
You&#39;ll find it difficult to get. May I recommend the
Edmeston Agency? It&#39;s about the only agency, now,
where any gasoline at all is obtainable. The Edmeston
Agency. I use it when I am in London. Ask for Mr.
Louis Grätz."</p>

<p class="indent">After a moment he added, "My chauffeur brought
your luggage, rücksack, stick, and so forth, from Yslemont.
You will go to the enemies&#39; lines south of Ostend
in my car. One of my aides-de-camp will accompany
you and show you a letter of instructions before delivering
you to the enemies&#39; flag of truce. You will
read the letter, learn it by heart, and return it to my
aide, Captain von Klipper.</p>

<p class="indent">"There is a bedroom above. Go up there. Food
will be sent you. Get what sleep you can, because you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
are to leave at sunrise. Is this arrangement agreeable
to you&mdash;<i>Monsieur le Comte de Gueldres</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Perfectly, General Baron von Reiter."</p>

<p class="indent">"Also. Then I have the honour to wish you good
night and a pleasant sleep."</p>

<p class="indent">"I thank you and I have the honour to wish you the
same," said Guild, bowing pleasantly.</p>

<p class="indent">General von Reiter stood aside and saluted with stiff
courtesy as the young man passed out.</p>

<p class="indent">A few moments later a regimental band somewhere
along the Yslemont highway began to play "Polen
Blut."</p>

<p class="indent">If blood were the theme, they ought to have played it
well enough.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>TIPPERARY</h3>

<p class="indent">At noon on the following day Kervyn Guild wrote
to his friend Darrel:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Harry</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">Instead of joining you on the Black Erenz for
the late August trout fishing I am obliged to go
elsewhere.</p>

<p class="indent">I have had a most unpleasant experience, and it
is not ended, and I do not yet know what the outcome
is to be.</p>

<p class="indent">From the fact that I have not dated this letter
it will be evident to you that I am not permitted
to do so. Also you will understand that I have
been caught somewhere in the war zone and that is
why the name of the place from which I am writing
you is omitted&mdash;by request.</p>

<p class="indent">We have halted for luncheon at a wayside inn&mdash;the
gentleman who is kind enough to accompany
me, and I&mdash;and I have obtained this benevolent
gentleman&#39;s authorization to write you whatever
I please as long as I do NOT</p>

<p class="indent">1st. Tell you where I am going.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
2d. Tell you where I am.</p>

<p class="indent">3d. Tell you anything else that does not suit
him.</p>

<p class="indent">And he isn&#39;t a censor at that; he is just a very
efficient, polite, and rather good-looking German
officer serving as aide on the staff of a certain
German major-general.</p>

<p class="indent">Day before yesterday, after luncheon, I was
playing a quiet game of chess with the Burgomaster
of a certain Belgian village, and was taking
a last look before setting out for Luxembourg
on foot, rücksack, stick, and all, when&mdash;well,
circumstances over which I had no control
interrupted the game of chess. It was white to
go and mate in three moves. The Burgomaster was
playing black. I had him, Harry. Too bad, because
he was the best player in&mdash;well in that
neighbourhood. I opened with a Lopez and he replied
most irregularly. It certainly was interesting.
I am sorry that I couldn&#39;t mate him and analyze
the game with him. However, thank
Heaven, I did announce mate in three moves,
and the old gentleman was still defiantly studying
the situation. I admit he refused to resign.</p>

<p class="indent">I left that village toward evening in a large,
grey automobile. I and the gentleman who still
accompanies me slept fairly well that night, considering
the fact that a town was on fire all
around us.</p>

<p class="indent">In the morning we made slow progress in our
automobile. Roads and fields were greenish grey
with troops&mdash;a vast horde of them possessed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
valleys; they enveloped the hills like fog-banks
turning the whole world grey&mdash;infantry, artillery,
cuirassiers, Uhlans, hussars&mdash;all mist colour
from helmet to heel&mdash;and so are their waggons
and guns and caissons and traction-engines and
motor-cycles and armoured cars and aeroplanes.</p>

<p class="indent">The latter are magnificent in an artistic sense&mdash;perfect
replicas of giant pigeon-hawks, circling,
planing, sheering the air or sailing high, majestic
as a very lammergeier, fierce, relentless, terrible.</p>

<p class="indent">My efficient companion who is reading this letter
over my shoulder as I write it, and who has
condescended to permit a ghost of a smile to
mitigate, now and then, the youthful seriousness
of his countenance, is not likely to object when I
say to you that what I have seen of the German
army on the march is astoundingly impressive.</p>

<p class="indent">(He smiles again very boyishly and says he
doesn&#39;t object.)</p>

<p class="indent">Order, precision, a knowledge of the country
absolutely unhesitating marks its progress. There
is much singing in the infantry ranks. The men
march well, their physique is fine, the cavalry are
superbly mounted, the guns&mdash;(He shakes his
head, so never mind the guns.)</p>

<p class="indent">Their regimental bands are wonderful. It is a
sheer delight to listen to them. They play everything
from "Polen Blut" and "Sari," to Sousa,
"Tannhäuser," and "A Hot Time," but I haven&#39;t
yet heard "Tipperary." (He seems puzzled at
this, but does not object.) I expect shortly to
hear a band playing it. (I have to explain to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
my efficient companion that "Tipperary" is a tune
which ought to take Berlin and Vienna <i>by storm</i>
when they hear it. It takes Berlin and Vienna
to really appreciate good music. He agrees
with me.)</p>

<p class="indent">Yesterday we passed a convoy of prisoners,
some were kilted. I was not permitted to speak to
them&mdash;but, Oh, those wistful eyes of Scottish blue!
I guess they understood, for they got all the tobacco
I had left. (My companion is doubtful
about this, but finally shrugs his shoulders.)</p>

<p class="indent">There is an awesome noise going on beyond us
in&mdash;well in a certain direction. I think that all
the artillery ever made is producing it. There&#39;s
practically no smoke visible against the clear blue
August sky&mdash;nothing to see at all except the feathery
cotton fleece of shrapnel appearing, expanding,
vanishing over a hill on the horizon, and two
aeroplanes circling high like a pair of mated
hawks.</p>

<p class="indent">And all the while this earth-rocking diapason
continues more terrible, more majestic than any
real thunder I ever heard.</p>

<p class="indent">We have had luncheon and are going on. He
drank five quarts of Belgian beer! I am permitted
a few minutes more and he orders the sixth
quart. This is what I have to say:</p>

<p class="indent">In case anything should go wrong with me give
the enclosed note to my mother. Please see to
it that everything I have goes to her. My will
is in my box in our safe at the office. It is all
quite clear. There should be no trouble.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
I expressed my trunk to your care in Luxembourg.
You wrote me that you had received it
and placed it in storage to await my leisurely arrival.
In case of accident to me send it to my
mother.</p>

<p class="indent">About the business, my share in any deals now
on should go to my brother. After that if you
care to take George in when he comes out of Harvard
it would gratify his mother and me.</p>

<p class="indent">He&#39;s all to the good, you know. But don&#39;t do
this if the business does not warrant it. Don&#39;t
do it out of sentiment, Harry. If he promises
to be of use, and if you have no other man in
view, and if, as I say, business conditions warrant
such an association with a view to eventual
partnership, then if you care to take in George
it will be all right.</p>

<p class="indent">He has sufficient capital, as you know. He
lacks only the business experience. And he is
intelligent and quick and it won&#39;t take him long.</p>

<p class="indent">But if you prefer somebody else don&#39;t hesitate.
George is perfectly able to take care of
his mother and himself.</p>

<p class="indent">This is all, I think. I&#39;m sorry about the August
fishing on the Black Erenz. It is a lovely
stream and full of trout. All Luxembourg is
lovely; it is a story-book country&mdash;a real land
of romance. I wish I might have seen it again.
Never were such forests, such silver streams,
such golden glades, such wild-flowers&mdash;never
such hills, such meadows, such skies.</p>

<p class="indent">Well&mdash;if I come back to you, I come back. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
not&mdash;good-bye, old fellow&mdash;with all it implies between
friends of many years.</p>

<p class="indent">Say to your kind friends, the Courlands, who so
graciously invited you to bring me with you to
Lesse Forest, that I shall not be able to accept
their delightful hospitality, and that my inability
to do so must remain to me a regret as long as
I live. (These guns are thundering enough to
crack the very sky! I really wish I could hear
some band playing "Tipperary.")</p>

<p class="indent">Good-bye for a while&mdash;or indefinitely. Good
luck to you.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Kervyn Guild.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">"Is that quite acceptable to you?" asked Guild of
the young Death&#39;s Head hussar beside him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Quite acceptable," replied the officer politely. "But
what is there remarkable in anybody drinking six quarts
of beer?"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild laughed: "Here is the note that I desire to
enclose with it, if I may do so." And he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Dearest</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">You must not grieve too much. You have
George. It could not be avoided, honourably.
He and I are good Americans; we are, perhaps,
something else, too. But what the Book of Gold
holds it never releases; what is written there is
never expunged. George must do what I did
when the time comes. I would have done more&mdash;was
meaning to&mdash;was on my way. Destiny has
ordered it otherwise.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
While I live I think always of you. And it
shall be so until the last.</p>

<p class="indent">This letter is to be sent to you by Harry Darrel
only in the event of my death.</p>

<p class="indent">There&#39;s a good chance for me. But if things
go wrong, then, good-bye, dearest.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Kervyn.</span></p>

<p>P. S.</p>

<p class="indent">Tell George that it&#39;s up to him, now.</p>

<p class="right">K.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">He held out the letter cheerfully to the hussar, but
the latter had read it, and he merely nodded in respectful
silence. So Guild folded it, sealed it in an envelope,
wrote on it, "For my Mother in case of my death," and
inclosed it in his letter to Darrel.</p>

<p class="indent">"Any time you are ready now," he said, rising from
the little enameled iron table under the arbour.</p>

<p class="indent">The hussar rose, clanking, and set a whistle to his
lips. Then, turning: "I shall have yet one more glass
of beer," he said blandly, but his eyes twinkled.</p>

<p class="indent">The grey car rolled up in a few moments. Over it
at a vast height something soared in hawk-like circles.
It may have been a hawk. There was no telling at
such a height.</p>

<p class="indent">So they drove off again amid the world-shaking din
of the guns paralleling the allied lines toward the west.
Ostend lay somewhere in that direction, the channel
flowed beyond; beyond that crouched England&mdash;where
bands were playing "Tipperary"&mdash;and where, perhaps,
a young girl was listening to that new battle song of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
which the young hussar beside him had never even
heard.</p>

<p class="indent">As the grey car hummed westward over the Belgian
road, Guild thought of these things while the whole
world about him was shaking with the earthquake of
the guns.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen," he repeated under his breath, "Karen
Girard."</p>

<p class="indent">After a while sentinels began to halt them every few
rods. The chauffeur unrolled two white flags and set
them in sockets on either side of the hood. The hussar
beside him produced a letter from his grey despatch-pouch.</p>

<p class="indent">"General von Reiter&#39;s orders," he said briefly. "You
are to read them now and return the letter to me before
the enemies&#39; parlementaire answers our flag."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild took the envelope, tore it open, and read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Orders received since our interview make it
impossible for me to tell you where to find me
on your return.</p>

<p class="indent">My country place in Silesia is apparently out
of the question at present as a residence for the
person you are expected to bring back with you.
The inclosed clipping from a Danish newspaper
will explain why. Therefore you will sail from
London on Wednesday or Sunday, taking a Holland
liner. You will land at Amsterdam, go by
rail through Utrecht, Helmond, Halen, Maastricht.
You will be expected there. If I am not
there you will remain over night.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
If you return from your journey <i>alone</i> and unsuccessful
you will surrender yourself as prisoner
to the nearest German post and ask the officer in
charge to telegraph me.</p>

<p class="indent">If you return successful you shall be permitted
at Eijsden to continue your journey with the person
you bring with you, across the Luxembourg
border to Trois Fontaines, which is just beyond
the Grand Duchy frontier; and you shall then deliver
the person in question to the housekeeper
of the hunting lodge, Marie Bergner. The lodge
is called Quellenheim, and it belongs to me. If
I am not there you must remain there over night.
In the morning if you do not hear from me, you
are at liberty to go where you please, and your
engagements vis-à-vis to me are cancelled.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">von Reiter</span>, Maj-Gen&#39;l.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The inclosed newspaper clipping had been translated
into French and written out in long-hand. The translation
read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Russia&#39;s invasion of East Prussia, Posen and
Silesia has sent a wave of panic over the eastern
provinces of the German Empire, if reports from
Copenhagen and Stockholm are to be credited.
These reports are chiefly significant as indicating
that the Russian advance is progressing more rapidly
than has been asserted even by despatches
from Petrograd.</p>

<p class="indent">A correspondent of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> reports
from Stockholm that the whole of eastern Germany
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
is upset by the menace of Cossack raids.
He hears that a diplomatic despatch from Vienna
contains information that the civilian inhabitants
of Koenigsberg, East Prussia, and Breslau, in
Silesia, are abandoning their homes and that only
the military will remain in these strongholds.</p>

<p class="indent">From Copenhagen it is reported, allegedly from
German sources, that Silesia expects devastation
by fire and sword and that the wealthy Prussian
landholders, whose immense estates cover Silesia,
are leading the exodus toward the west. The military
authorities have done everything possible to
check the panic, fearing its hurtful influence on
Germany&#39;s prospects, but have been unable to reassure
the inhabitants. Many of these have seen
bands of Cossacks who have penetrated a few
miles over the border and their warnings have
spread like a forest fire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">For a long while the young man studied the letter,
reading and re-reading it, until, closing his eyes, he
could repeat it word for word.</p>

<p class="indent">And when he was letter perfect he nodded and handed
back the letter to the hussar, who pouched it.</p>

<p class="indent">A moment later the car ran in among a horde of
mounted Uhlans, and one of their officers came galloping
up alongside of the machine.</p>

<p class="indent">He and the hussar whispered together for a few minutes,
then an Uhlan was summoned, a white cloth tied
to his lance-shaft, and away he went on his powerful
horse, the white flag snapping in the wind. Behind
him cantered an Uhlan trumpeter.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
Toward sunset the grey automobile rolled west out
into open country. A vast flat plain stretched to the
horizon, where the sunset flamed scarlet and rose.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was almost dusk before from somewhere across
the plain came the faint strains of military music.</p>

<p class="indent">The hussar&#39;s immature mustache bristled. "British!"
he remarked. "Gott in Himmel, what barbarous
music!"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild said nothing. They were playing "Tipperary."</p>

<p class="indent">And now, through the late rays of the afterglow, an
Uhlan trumpeter, sitting his horse on the road ahead,
set his trumpet to his lips and sounded the parley again.
Far, silvery, from the misty southwest, a British bugle
answered.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild strained his eyes. Nothing moved on the plain.
But, at a nod to the chauffeur from the hussar, the
great grey automobile rolled forward, the two Uhlans
walking their horses on either side.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly, east and west as far as the eye could see,
trenches in endless parallels cut the plain, swarming
with myriads and myriads of men in misty grey.</p>

<p class="indent">The next moment the hussar had passed a black silk
handkerchief over Guild&#39;s eyes and was tying it rather
tightly.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>BAD DREAMS</h3>

<p class="indent">His first night in London was like a bad dream
to him. Lying half awake on his bed, doggedly,
tenaciously awaiting the sleep he needed,
at intervals even on its vision-haunted borderland, but
never drifting across it, he remained always darkly conscious
of his errand and of his sinister predicament.</p>

<p class="indent">The ineffaceable scenes of the last three days obsessed
him; his mind seemed to be unable to free itself. The
quieter he lay, the more grimly determined he became
that sleep should blot out these tragic memories for a
few hours at least, the more bewildering grew the confusion
in his haunted mind. Continually new details
were evoked by his treacherous and insurgent memory&mdash;trifles
terrible in their minor significance&mdash;the frightened
boy against the wall snivelling against his ragged
shirt-sleeve&mdash;the sprawling attitudes of the dead men
in the dusty grass&mdash;and how, after a few moments, a
mangled arm moved, blindly groping&mdash;and what
quieted it.</p>

<p class="indent">Incidents, the petty details of sounds, of odours, of
things irrelevant, multiplied and possessed him&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
thin gold-rimmed spectacles on the Burgomaster&#39;s nose
and the honest, incredulous eyes which gazed through
them at him when he announced checkmate in three
moves.</p>

<p class="indent">Did that tranquil episode happen years ago in
another and calmer life?&mdash;or a few hours ago in
this?</p>

<p class="indent">He heard again the startling and ominous sounds of
raiding cavalry even before they had become visible in
the misty street&mdash;the flat slapping gallop of the Uhlan&#39;s
horses on the paved way, the tinkling clash of broken
glass. Again the thick, sour, animal-like stench of the
unwashed infantry seemed to assail and sicken him to
the verge of faintness; and, half awake, he saw a world
of fog set thick with human faces utterly detached from
limbs and bodies&mdash;thousands and thousands of faces
watching him out of thousands and thousands of little
pig-like eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">His nerves finally drove him into motion and he
swung himself out of bed and walked to the window.</p>

<p class="indent">His hotel was the Berkeley, and he looked out across
Piccadilly into a silent, sad, unlighted city of shadows.
Only a single line of lighted lamps outlined the broad
thoroughfare. Crimson sparks twinkled here and there&mdash;the
lights of cabs.</p>

<p class="indent">The great darkened Ritz towered opposite, Devonshire
House squatted behind its grilles and shadowy
walls on the right, and beyond the great dark thoroughfare
stretched away into the night, melancholy, deserted
save for the slight stirring of a policeman here and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
there or the passage of an automobile running in silence
without lights.</p>

<p class="indent">He had been standing by the window for ten minutes
or so, a lighted cigarette between his lips, both hands
dropped into the pocket of his pyjamas, when he became
aware of a slight sound&mdash;a very slight one&mdash;behind
him.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned around and his eyes fell upon the knob of
the door. Whether or not it was turning he could not
determine in the dusk of the room. The only light in
it came through his windows from the starry August
night-sky.</p>

<p class="indent">After a moment he walked toward the door, bare-footed
across the velvet carpet, halted, fixed his eyes on
the door knob.</p>

<p class="indent">After a moment it began to turn again, almost imperceptibly.
And, in him, every over-wrought nerve
tightened to its full tension till he quivered. Slowly,
discreetly, noiselessly the knob continued to turn. The
door was not locked. Presently it began to open, the
merest fraction of an inch at a time; then, abruptly but
stealthily, it began to close again, as though the unseen
intruder had caught sight of him, and Guild stepped
forward swiftly and jerked the door wide open.</p>

<p class="indent">There was only the darkened hallway there, and a
servant with a tray who said very coolly, "Thanky, sir,"
and entered the room.</p>

<p class="indent">"What-do-you-want?" asked Guild unsteadily.</p>

<p class="indent">"You ordered whiskey and soda for eleven o&#39;clock,
sir."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
"I did not. Why do you try to enter my room without
knocking?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I understood your orders were not to disturb you
but to place the tray on the night-table beside your bed,
sir."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild regarded him steadily. The servant, clean-shaven,
typical, encountered the young man&#39;s gaze respectfully
and with no more disturbance than seemed
natural under the circumstances of a not unusual
blunder.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild&#39;s nerves relaxed and he drew a deep, quiet
breath.</p>

<p class="indent">"Somebody has made a mistake," he said. "I ordered
nothing. And, hereafter, anybody coming to my door
will knock. Is that plain?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Perfectly, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Have the goodness to make it very plain to the
management."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m sorry, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"You understand, now?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well.... And, by the way, who on this corridor
is likely to have ordered that whiskey?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Somebody ordered it, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Very likely the gentleman next door, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"All right," said Guild quietly. "Try the door while
I stand here and look on."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very good, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">With equanimity unimpaired the waiter stepped to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
the next door on the corridor, placed his tray flat on the
palm of his left hand, and, with his right hand, began
to turn the knob, using, apparently, every precaution
to make no noise.</p>

<p class="indent">But he was not successful; the glassware on his tray
suddenly gave out a clear, tinkling clash, and, at the
same moment the bedroom door opened from within
and a man in evening dress appeared dimly framed by
the doorway.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sorry, sir," said the waiter, "your whiskey, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He stepped inside the room and the door closed behind
him. Guild quietly waited. Presently the waiter
reappeared without the tray.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come here," motioned Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">The waiter said: "Yes, sir," in a natural voice.
Doubtless the man next door could hear it, too.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild, annoyed, lowered his own voice: "Who is the
gentleman in the next room?"</p>

<p class="indent">"A Mr. Vane, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"From where?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"What is he, English?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes sir, I believe so."</p>

<p class="indent">"You don&#39;t happen to know his business, do you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"I ask&mdash;it&#39;s merely curiosity. Wait a moment." He
turned, picked up a sovereign from a heap of coins on
his night-table and gave it to the waiter.</p>

<p class="indent">"No need to repeat to anybody what I have asked
you."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
"Oh, no, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"All right. Listen very attentively to what I tell
you. When I arrived here this afternoon I desired the
management to hire for my use a powerful and absolutely
reliable touring car and a chauffeur. I mentioned
the Edmeston Agency and a Mr. Louis Grätz.</p>

<p class="indent">"Half an hour later the management informed me that
they had secured such a car for me from Mr. Louis
Grätz at the Edmeston Agency; that I was permitted
sufficient gasoline to take me from here to Westheath,
back here again, and then to the docks of the Holland
Steamship Company next Sunday.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ve changed my mind. Tomorrow is Wednesday
and a steamer sails from Fresh Wharf for Amsterdam.
Tell the management that I&#39;ll take that steamer
and that I want them to telephone the Edmeston
Agency to have the car here at six o&#39;clock tomorrow
morning."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very good, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Go down and tell them now. Ask them to confirm
the change of orders by telephone."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very good, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">A quarter of an hour later the bell tinkled in his
room: "Are you there, sir? Thank you, sir. The car
is to be here at six o&#39;clock. What time would you breakfast,
Mr. Guild?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Five. Have it served here, please."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild went back to bed. Another detail bothered
him now. If the man next door had ordered whiskey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
and soda for eleven, <i>to be placed on the night-table beside
the bed</i>, why was he up and dressed and ready to
open the door when the jingle of glassware awaited
him?</p>

<p class="indent">Still there might be various natural explanations.
Guild thought of several, but none of them suited him.</p>

<p class="indent">He began to feel dull and sleepy. That is the last
he remembered, except that his sleep was disturbed by
vaguely menacing dreams, until he awoke in the grey
light of early morning, scarcely refreshed, and heard
the waiter knocking. He rose, unlocked his door, and
let him in with his tray.</p>

<p class="indent">When the waiter went out again Guild relocked his
door, turned on his bath, took it red hot and then icy.
And, thoroughly awake, now, he returned to his room,
breakfasted, dressed, rang for his account, and a few
minutes later descended in the lift to find his car and
chauffeur waiting, and the tall, many-medalled porter at
salute by the door.</p>

<p class="indent">"Westheath," he said to the smiling chauffeur. "Go
as fast as you dare and by the direct route."</p>

<p class="indent">The chauffeur touched his peaked cap. He seemed
an ideal chauffeur, neat, alert, smiling, well turned out
in fact as the magnificent and powerful touring car
which had been as thoroughly and minutely groomed
as a race-horse or a debutante.</p>

<p class="indent">When the car rolled out into Piccadilly the waiter who
had mistaken the order for whiskey, watched it from the
dining-room windows. Several floors above, the man who
had occupied the next bedroom also watched the departure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
of the car. When it was out of sight the man whose
name was Vane went to the telephone and called 150
Fenchurch Street, E. C. It was the office of the Holland
Steamship Company.</p>

<p class="indent">And the waiter who had entered the room unannounced,
stood listening to the conversation over the
wire, and finally took the transmitter himself for further
conversation while Vane stood by listening, one hand
resting familiarly on the waiter&#39;s shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">After the waiter had hung up the receiver, Vane
walked to the window, stood a moment looking out, then
came slowly back.</p>

<p class="indent">"Gwynn," he said to the waiter, "this man, Guild,
seems to be harmless. He&#39;s known at the American Embassy.
He&#39;s an American in the real estate business in
New York. It&#39;s true that Dart telegraphed from
Ostend that Guild came to our lines in a German military
automobile under a white flag. But he told a
straight story. I&#39;ll run out to Westheath, and if his
business there is clean and above-board, I think we can
give him a clean bill of health."</p>

<p class="indent">Gwynn said, slowly: "I don&#39;t like the way he questioned
me last night. Besides, a sovereign is too much
even for an American."</p>

<p class="indent">"He might have been afraid of robbery."</p>

<p class="indent">"He was afraid of <i>something</i>."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well. We&#39;ve passage on the boat if necessary.
I&#39;ll go out to Westheath anyway. If I don&#39;t care for
what he is doing out there we can hold him on the dock."</p>

<p class="indent">"Another thing," mused Gwynn. "The Edmeston
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
Agency may be quite all right, but the man&#39;s name is
Grätz."</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s been under scrutiny. He seems to be all right."</p>

<p class="indent">"All the same&mdash;his name is all wrong. What was
that chauffeur&#39;s name?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Bush."</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Busch?</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">"He spells it without a <i>c</i>. I saw his signature on the
Agency rolls."</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you his history?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s Canadian. I&#39;ve sent for it."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;ll find that his father spelled his name with a
<i>c</i>," remarked Gwynn, gloomily. But Vane only laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m off," he said. "Stick around where I can get
you on the telephone if necessary. But I don&#39;t think it
will be necessary."</p>

<p class="indent">"I do," muttered Gwynn.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>KAREN</h3>

<p class="indent">The journey was the usual one through interminable
London streets alternately respectable and
squalid; and straight ahead through equally
interminable suburbs with their endless "terraces,"
semi-detached and detached villas, and here and there a
fine old house behind neglected garden walls, making its
last forlorn stand against the all-destroying inroad of
the London jungle.</p>

<p class="indent">There had been a heavy haze in London, but no fog.
In the country, however, beyond the last outstretched
suburban tentacle of the inky octopus the morning sun
glimmered low through a golden smother, promising a
glimpse of blue sky.</p>

<p class="indent">To Guild, one "heath" has always resembled another,
and now, as they passed through the country at high
speed, there seemed to him very little difference between
the several named points which marked his progress
toward Westheath. Hedges alternated with ivy-covered
walls on either side of a wide, fine road; trees were
splendid as usual, sheep fat, cattle sleek. Here and
there a common or heath glimmered bewitchingly where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
sunlight fell among the whins; birds winged their way,
waters glimmered, and the clean, singing August wind
of England blew steadily in his face strangely reviving
within him some ancient, forgotten, pre-natal wistfulness.
Maybe it came from his American mother&#39;s English
mother.</p>

<p class="indent">Near two villages and once on the open highway
policemen leisurely signalled the chauffeur to stop, and
came sauntering around to the tonneau to question
Guild as to his origin, his business, and his destination;
quiet, dignified, civil, respectable men they seemed to be
in their night cloaks and their always smart and business-like
helmets and uniforms.</p>

<p class="indent">All seemed satisfied, but all politely suggested that
passports were now becoming fashionable in England.
And Guild thanked them pleasantly and drove on.</p>

<p class="indent">"Bush," he said to his chauffeur, "this spy scare was
ridiculed by the newspapers, but it looks to me as
though it were being taken rather seriously after all."</p>

<p class="indent">"It is, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"I understand that about thirty thousand German
and Austrian reservists have been arrested in England
since war began?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I hear so, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose the country really is swarming with spies.
The paper yesterday said that there was still a great
and serious leakage of military information out of England.
One paper, yesterday afternoon, reported that a
number of spies had already been shot in the Tower."</p>

<p class="indent">"I have heard so, sir," said the chauffeur smilingly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
He was a blond, good-looking young fellow. Always
his lips seemed to rest in pleasant curves as though his
reveries were agreeable.</p>

<p class="indent">A few hideously modern detached villas were passed,
then hedges, walls, a wood, a modern bridge.</p>

<p class="indent">"How near are we to Westheath now?" asked Guild,
leaning forward in his seat.</p>

<p class="indent">"We are there, sir." And the smiling chauffeur
slowed the car to a standstill at a cross-roads where
furze and broom grew rankly over the heath and a few
rather tawdry villas appeared among the trees beyond.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild looked at his watch. It was only a little after
seven, an unearthly hour for a call upon any young
girl, not to mention one to whom he was personally unknown.</p>

<p class="indent">A policeman still wearing his waterproof night cloak,
came leisurely across to learn what was wanted.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am looking for the villa of Miss Girard&mdash;Miss
Karen Girard," explained Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hyacinth Villa, Number 169. Take the road to
the right. It is the only house."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thank you."</p>

<p class="indent">The car moved forward, swung to the right. About
a quarter of a mile away stood a small, modern stucco
dwelling behind its hedge of privet. Beyond that there
were woods again and dewy uplands glimmering with
furze and brake.</p>

<p class="indent">When they arrived they found the driveway closed by
a gate.</p>

<p class="indent">"Never mind; I&#39;ll walk to the house," said Guild.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
The smiling chauffeur leaned back and opened the
tonneau door; Guild descended, looked at the iron gate
between its ugly stucco posts, peered through it up the
drive with its parallel rows of recently planted lime
trees. Everything about the place was recent if not
brand new&mdash;ugly with the ugliness of well-to-do bad
taste. Red geraniums and yellow cannas had been
planted in fearsome juxtaposition, salvia flanked a
red brick terrace&mdash;a most unholy combination of colour.
In the early morning the sun exposed the place
without mercy. It was lonesome and amazingly depressing.</p>

<p class="indent">Glancing up at the gate again he discovered a nickel-plated
label riveted to one of the stucco posts. On it
was the name of the place, "Hyacinth Villa," and its
number 169.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no lodge, no bell, but the wicket gate was
not locked. So Guild entered.</p>

<p class="indent">"Shall I drive up to the house, sir?" inquired the
chauffeur.</p>

<p class="indent">"No; wait out here."</p>

<p class="indent">There seemed to be no sign of life about the house
when at last he arrived in front of it&mdash;nobody apparently
stirring at that hour. He hesitated; he still wore
the same knickerbockers and cap which he had worn in
Belgium. His sack, which was now in the car, contained
only fresh linen; and he began to wonder what
his reception might be in such a costume and at such
an hour. He doubted that the unconventionality of the
daughter of a Prussian aristocrat might extend far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
enough to accept him, his rather shabby clothes, and his
explanation of the visit.</p>

<p class="indent">It was all very well for this young girl to kick over
the tradition, cut home traces in the sacred cause of art,
call herself Girard, and live in an impossible villa for
art&#39;s sake. Few well-born Fräuleins ever did this sort
of thing, but there had been instances. And anybody
in Germany will always add that they invariably went to
the devil.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild rang. After he had waited long enough he
rang again. After that he resumed his ringing. Keeping
his finger pressed on the electric button and laying
his ear to the door. The bell was doing its duty inside
the house; he could hear it.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently he heard a fumbling of chains and locks
inside, the door opened on a crack and a sleepy voice
inquired: "Is it you, Anna?"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild hesitated: "I wish to see Miss Girard. Is she
at home?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Who are you?" demanded the voice no longer
sleepy.</p>

<p class="indent">"My name is Guild. I am sorry to disturb Miss
Girard at such an hour, but I cannot help it. Is Miss
Girard in?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; I am Miss Girard."</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you Miss Karen Girard?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. Why do you wish to see me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t tell you here. Are you dressed?"</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause, then she said: "No."</p>

<p class="indent">"Please dress as quickly as you can. Dress for travel."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
"What!"</p>

<p class="indent">"If you have a travelling dress put it on. You can
pack your luggage while I am talking to you. But dress
as quickly as you can and then return and let me in."</p>

<p class="indent">She said after a moment&#39;s silence: "I certainly shall
not do any of those things until I know more about you
and about your errand here."</p>

<p class="indent">"I have a message for you from General Baron Kurt
von Reiter."</p>

<p class="indent">"That is possible," she said quietly. "What is the
message?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I was to say to you that the question which you were
to decide on the first of November must be decided
sooner."</p>

<p class="indent">"I must have clearer proof that your message is genuine.
I am sorry to distrust you but I have been annoyed
lately."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well," he said. "Open the door a little more.
Don&#39;t be afraid. I merely wish you to look at a ring
which I wear. I want you to draw it from my finger and
look at what is engraved inside."</p>

<p class="indent">There was another silence. Then the door crack
slowly widened.</p>

<p class="indent">"Please extend your hand," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">There was just enough of space for him to slip his
hand between door and frame and he did so. There
came a light, soft touch on his ring-finger. The ring
slipped off.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 401px;">
<a name="gs03" id="gs03"></a><img class="border" src="images/gs03.jpg" width="401" height="700" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">"There came a light, soft touch on his ring-finger"</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">When she spoke again her voice was altered: "I
shall dress immediately," she said. "I shall not keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
you waiting long. You will find the door open. Please
come in when I have gone upstairs."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thank you."</p>

<p class="indent">He could hear her light, flying feet on the stairs; he
waited a little longer, then opened the door.</p>

<p class="indent">The hallway was dark, and he left the door open,
then entered the room to the left which seemed to be a
library, music-room and living-room combined. Books,
piano, easy chairs and sofas loomed in the dim light of
drawn curtains. An easel on which stood a water-colour
drawing occupied the end of the room, and beside it was
a table on which were porcelain dishes, tubes of colour
and scattered badger brushes.</p>

<p class="indent">It was evident that Miss Girard&#39;s talents were multiple,
for he noticed also a violin and music stand near
the piano, and on the violin score as well as on the score
spread across the piano the same hand had written
"Karen Girard."</p>

<p class="indent">He stood by the table, mechanically picking up, one
after another, the books lying there. Some of the books
were printed in French, some in German, in Italian, in
Danish, in Swedish, in English. Miss Girard&#39;s name
was written in all of them. Miss Girard appeared to
be accomplished.</p>

<p class="indent">In the dim light Guild began to saunter around the
room encountering various evidences of Miss Girard&#39;s
taste and mode of living&mdash;one or two Braun photographs
of Velasquez, Boucher, and Gainsborough on
the walls&mdash;certainly a catholicism of taste entirely admirable;&mdash;one
or two graceful bits of ancient Chinese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
art&mdash;blue and gold marvels of Pekin enamel; a mille-fleur
tapestry panel, a bundle of golf clubs, a tennis
bat, and a pair of spurs.</p>

<p class="indent">He thought for himself that when a girl goes in for
all of these accomplishments it is because the gods have
been otherwise unkind, and that she has to.</p>

<p class="indent">At the same time he remembered the voice he had
heard through the scarcely opened door&mdash;the lovely
voice of a young English girl&mdash;than which in all the
world there is nothing half so lovely.</p>

<p class="indent">And it suddenly occurred to him that there had not
been in it the faintest kind or trace of a German accent&mdash;that
only its childish and sleepy sweetness had struck
him first, and then its purity and its youthful and
cultivated charm.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, truly, the gods had been kind to this young
German girl of nineteen, but it would be a little too
much to ask of these same gods that they endow her
with figure and features commensurate with her other
charms and talents.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he suddenly remembered her profession, and
that she was studying still for the dramatic profession.
And he knew that this profession naturally required
exterior charm of any woman who desired to
embrace it.</p>

<p class="indent">While these ideas and speculations were occupying his
mind he heard her on the stairs, and he turned and came
forward as she entered the room.</p>

<p class="indent">She was a slender, straight girl of medium height;
and her face was one of those fresh young faces which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
looked fragrant. And instantly the thought occurred
to him that she was the vivid, living incarnation of her
own voice, with her lilac-blue eyes and soft white neck,
and the full scarlet lips of one of those goddesses who
was not very austere.</p>

<p class="indent">She wore a loosely-belted jacket of tan-coloured covert-cloth,
and narrow skirts of the same, and a wide
golden-brown hat, and tan spats. The gods had been
very, very kind to Miss Girard, for she even adorned her
clothes, and that phenomenon is not usual in Great
Britain or among German Fräuleins however accomplished
and however well born.</p>

<p class="indent">She said: "I beg your pardon for detaining you so
long on the outside door-step. Since the war began my
maid and I have been annoyed by strangers telephoning
and even coming here to ask silly and impertinent questions.
I suppose," she added, disdainfully, "it is because
there is so much suspicion of foreigners in England."</p>

<p class="indent">"I quite understand," he said. "Being German, your
neighbors gossip."</p>

<p class="indent">She shrugged her indifference.</p>

<p class="indent">"Shall we talk here?" she asked gravely, resting one
very white hand on the back of a chair. "You come
from General Baron Kurt von Reiter. The ring is a
credential beyond dispute."</p>

<p class="indent">"We can talk anywhere you wish," he said, "but there
is little time, and somebody must pack a traveller&#39;s
satchel for you. Have you a maid?"</p>

<p class="indent">"She went to London yesterday evening. She was to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
have returned on the eleven o&#39;clock train last night. I
can&#39;t understand it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you alone in the house?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. My cook sleeps out. She does not come until
half-past nine. My maid serves my breakfast."</p>

<p class="indent">"You haven&#39;t had any, then?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"Can you fix something for yourself?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, of course. Shall I do so now?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. I&#39;ll go to the kitchen with you while you are
doing it. There are several things to say and the time
is short."</p>

<p class="indent">She led the way; he opened the kitchen shutters and
let in the sunshine, then stood a moment watching her
as she moved about the place with graceful celerity, preparing
cocoa over an alcohol lamp, buttering a roll or
two and fetching cup, plate, spoon and marmalade.</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you breakfasted?" she asked, looking at him
over her shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;it is very good of you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"There will be plenty of cocoa and rolls&mdash;if you care
for them. The rolls are yesterday&#39;s and not fresh."</p>

<p class="indent">She poured the cocoa in two cups and looked at him
again in grave invitation.</p>

<p class="indent">"You are sure there is plenty?" he asked, smilingly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Plenty."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then&mdash;I do seem to be rather hungry."</p>

<p class="indent">He drew a chair for her; she seated herself and ate
with a youthful appetite. He drank his cocoa, ate his
rolls, and tried not to look at her too often.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
"This is why I am here," he said. "I saw General
Baron von Reiter four days ago under somewhat extraordinary
circumstances.</p>

<p class="indent">"He told me that since the war broke out he had not
been able to communicate directly with you or to get you
out of England, and he asked me to find you and bring
you to his estate at Trois Fontaines in Luxembourg."</p>

<p class="indent">"To Quellenheim?" she asked, surprised and disturbed.
"Is he there?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, he is with a field army, and he does not know
where orders from staff headquarters may send him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Still," she said, hesitating, "I should think that he
might wish me to go to Silesia&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Silesia is threatened by the Russian army."</p>

<p class="indent">"Silesia!" she repeated, incredulously. "Cossacks in
Silesia?" She sat, her cup of cocoa half raised to her
lips, her surprised and disconcerted eyes on his. Then
she set the cup aside.</p>

<p class="indent">"He wishes me to go to Quellenheim? With <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Travelling on the continent is precarious."</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes rested on his; she said with a candour which
he began to understand was characteristic of her: "He
seems to have confidence in you. I never heard him
speak of you. You are American?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"That is odd. He never cared for Americans."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild said: "He could not send a German into England."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
"That is true. Nor an Englishman either. No Englishman
would be likely to do anything to oblige a German."</p>

<p class="indent">She rose: "I don&#39;t understand why Anna, my maid,
is still absent," she added uneasily. "My maid often
goes to London, but never before has she remained over
night. I don&#39;t know why she remained. She knew I
was alone in the house."</p>

<p class="indent">She lifted her serious blue eyes to Guild, then gazed
out of the window, evidently perplexed to the point of
apprehension.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am worried," she said, "very much worried. But
that doesn&#39;t help, does it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What was her errand in London?" asked Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"She has a brother there. I suppose it&#39;s all right or
she would have telephoned me."</p>

<p class="indent">He said: "No doubt it is all right. And, may I ask
you to hasten?"</p>

<p class="indent">She rose: "Where am I to go with you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"To London and then to the steamer."</p>

<p class="indent">"Today?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Today is Wednesday. No other Holland Line boat
sails for Amsterdam before Sunday, and I have yet
our passage to secure and I must also go to the War
Office for a few moments. You see we have very little
time."</p>

<p class="indent">"But I can&#39;t pack my boxes then?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You will have to leave them."</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean I may take only a satchel?"</p>

<p class="indent">"A suit-case and satchel if you wish. Leave a note
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
for your maid instructing her to send by express whatever
else you wish sent after you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is this haste necessary, Mr. Guild?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, it is. I want to get out of England. I am not
sure that I can get out if we wait until Sunday."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why not?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I may be detained. I may not be permitted to leave
with you. All foreigners are under more or less suspicion.
I am rather sure that I have been under surveillance
already at the Berkeley Hotel."</p>

<p class="indent">They had moved out into the hall together while
he was speaking, and now, together, they went up the
stairs.</p>

<p class="indent">"If you don&#39;t mind," she said, "my room is in disorder,
but I&#39;ll have to pack there and you will have to
sit there if you wish to talk to me."</p>

<p class="indent">It was a white and chintz room in dainty disorder.</p>

<p class="indent">She went away and returned in a moment or two with
a satchel and suit-case. These she placed on the bed,
opened, and then, dragging out various drawers of chiffonier
and chest, began to transfer her apparel to the
two bags.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am extremely sorry," he said, "to hurry you so
inconveniently."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t mind," she replied, busy with her packing.
"You see I am an actress and I have travelled with a
company in the provinces. That <i>was</i> an experience!"
She turned her pretty head and looked at Guild. "I
had no maid then, except at the theatres where we
played, and I had to share her with three other girls.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
Really, Mr. Guild, it taught me how to pack things
rather rapidly."</p>

<p class="indent">Her white hands were flying as she folded and placed
garment after garment in the suit-case, serene, self-possessed,
quite undisturbed by his presence at the
rather intimate display of her apparel.</p>

<p class="indent">The garments were bewilderingly frail to him; she
tucked and packed them into place; a faint fresh scent
seemed to freshen the place.</p>

<p class="indent">He said: "I don&#39;t think we are going to have any
trouble about leaving England. But, if any trouble
does arise, would you have sufficient confidence in me to
do what I say?"</p>

<p class="indent">She continued her packing for a few moments without
replying, then turned and looked at him.</p>

<p class="indent">And at the same moment the telephone on the table
beside her bed tinkled.</p>

<p class="indent">"There is Anna now!" she exclaimed with the emphasis
of relief. "Will you pardon me? No, I don&#39;t
mean you are to leave the room&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">She lifted the receiver: "Yes, I am here....
Yes, this is Miss Girard. Yes, Miss Karen Girard....
Mr. Louis Grätz? Oh, good morning!"</p>

<p class="indent">At the name of the man with whom she was speaking
Guild turned around surprised. At the same instant
the girl&#39;s face flushed brightly as she sat listening to
what the distant Mr. Grätz was saying to her.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild watched her; perplexity, surprise, a deeper
flush of consternation, all were successively visible on
her youthful face.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
"Yes," she said to Mr. Grätz. "Yes, I will do whatever
he wishes.... Yes, he is here&mdash;here in my
room with me. We were talking while I packed. Yes, I
will do so." And, turning her head a little she said to
the young man behind her: "The Edmeston Agency desires
to speak to you."</p>

<p class="indent">He rose and took the receiver from her hand and bent
over beside her listening.</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you there?" inquired a pleasant voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"I am Grätz of the Edmeston Agency. Get that
young lady out of the house at once. Do you understand?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Her maid is in trouble. This agency may be in
trouble at any moment. She must not wait to pack.
Get her into the car and take her to the wharf and on
board at once. Do you understand?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Take her as your wife. Do you understand?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I understand what you say," he said, amazed.</p>

<p class="indent">"That is sufficient. Do as I tell you if you want to
leave England."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well. But I must first go to the War
Office&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I must!"</p>

<p class="indent">"No. It is useless; hopeless. It would have been the
thing to do yesterday. An explanation there would
have given you credentials and security. But not today.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
<i>She</i> could not hope to leave. Do you understand?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, but I hear you."</p>

<p class="indent">"She could not expect permission to leave because her
maid has been arrested."</p>

<p class="indent">"What!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes! The charge is most serious."</p>

<p class="indent">"What is it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Get into your car with the young lady and start at
once. Don&#39;t go to the steamship office in Fenchurch
Street. Don&#39;t go to the War Office. Go nowhere except
to the wharf. Your passage has been secured as Mr.
and Mrs. Kervyn Guild of New York. The initials on
the baggage will be K. G. Your steamer tickets will be
handed to you. You will pay no attention to the man
who hands them to you, no attention to anybody. You
will go aboard and go to your cabin until the ship is out
at sea. Do you understand?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Perfectly."</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-bye."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>MR. AND MRS.</h3>

<p class="indent">Guild hung up the receiver, stood a moment in
thought then turned around and looked
gravely at the girl behind him. She gazed
back at him as though still a trifle breathless after some
sudden shock.</p>

<p class="indent">"What did that man say to you over the wire?" he
asked in pleasant, even tones.</p>

<p class="indent">"He told me to trust you, and do what you told me
to do. He said Anna, my maid, had been arrested."</p>

<p class="indent">"Who is he?" asked Guild grimly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you mean Mr. Grätz?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; who is Mr. Grätz?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t <i>you</i> know him?" she said, astonished.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have never laid eyes on him. Your father recommended
to me the Edmeston Agency and mentioned the
name of a Louis Grätz who might be of use to me.
That is all I know."</p>

<p class="indent">"My&mdash;<i>father</i>&mdash;you say?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Certainly, General Baron von Reiter."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh!... Then it must be quite all right. Only&mdash;I
don&#39;t understand about my maid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
"Did Mr. Grätz tell you she had been arrested?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"On a serious charge?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you any idea what that charge may be?" he
asked, studying her face.</p>

<p class="indent">"I haven&#39;t any idea," she said; "have you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know; perhaps I have. Is your maid German?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"You brought her with you from Germany?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Where did you get her?"</p>

<p class="indent">"General von Reiter&#39;s housekeeper found her for
me."</p>

<p class="indent">He hesitated, still looking steadily into those violet
blue eyes of hers which seemed to question him so candidly.
No, there could be no dishonesty there.</p>

<p class="indent">"Miss Girard," he said, "I find that I am going to
be very much more frank with you than there once
seemed any occasion for being. I am also going to say
something to you that may possibly offend you. But
I can&#39;t help it. It is this: Have you, through your letters
to or from your father, imparted or received any
military intelligence which might be detrimental to
Great Britain or to her allies?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you mean am I a sort of spy?" she asked, flushing
to the roots of her hair.</p>

<p class="indent">"In substance it amounts to that. And I shall have
to ask you to answer me. And I&#39;ll tell you why I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
ask. I didn&#39;t intend to tell you; my personal and private
affairs did not concern you. But they do now.
And these happen to be the facts in my case: I was
taken prisoner in Belgium by the cavalry forming the
advance of your father&#39;s command. It happened four
days ago; I was sentenced to military execution, led
out for that purpose, reprieved by your father himself
on condition that I undertake to find you and conduct
you safely to Trois Fontaines near the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg.</p>

<p class="indent">"If I am unsuccessful in the undertaking, I am
pledged to go back voluntarily and face a firing squad.
If I am successful I am permitted to go free, and so are
my fellow-hostages. And the little town where I was
arrested is to be spared."</p>

<p class="indent">He passed one hand over his eyes, thoughtfully, then,
looking at her very seriously:</p>

<p class="indent">"There seemed to be no reason why an honorable
man might not accept such terms. I accepted them.
But&mdash;things have happened here which I neither understand
nor like. And I&#39;ve got to say this to you; if
my taking you back to your father means any detriment
to England or to the cause England represents&mdash;in
other words, if your returning to him means the imparting
to him of any military information gathered
here by you, then&mdash;I won&#39;t take you back; that&#39;s all!"</p>

<p class="indent">After a moment, half to herself, she said: "He really
thinks me a spy. I knew it!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I <i>don&#39;t</i> think so. I am merely asking you!" he retorted
impatiently. "There is something dead wrong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
here. I was intending to go to the War Office to tell
them there very frankly about my predicament, and to
ask permission to take you back in order to save my
fellow-hostages, the village, and my own life; and now
a man named Grätz of whom I know nothing calls me
on the telephone and warns me not to go to the War
Office but to get you out of England as soon as I can
do it.</p>

<p class="indent">"What am I to think of this? What does this man
Grätz mean when he tells me that your maid has been
arrested on a serious charge and that the Edmeston
Agency of a German automobile is in danger?"</p>

<p class="indent">The girl stood very still with one slender hand resting
on her satchel, her face pale and quietly serious,
her brows bent slightly inward as though she were trying
to remember something or to solve some unpleasant
problem not yet plain to her.</p>

<p class="indent">"One thing is clear," she said after a moment, lifting
her candid eyes to his; "and that is, if you don&#39;t
take me back certain friends of yours will be executed
and a village in which you seem interested will be
destroyed."</p>

<p class="indent">"If taking you back means any harm to England,"
he said, "I won&#39;t take you."</p>

<p class="indent">"And&mdash;your friends? What becomes of them?"</p>

<p class="indent">"My friends and the village must take the same
chances that I do."</p>

<p class="indent">"What chances? Do you mean to go back without
<i>me</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I said I would," he replied drily.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
"You said that if you went back without me they&#39;d
execute you."</p>

<p class="indent">"That&#39;s what I said. But there&#39;s no use in speculating
on what is likely to happen to me if I go back
without you. If you don&#39;t mind I think we had better
start at once. We have had our warning from this man
Grätz."</p>

<p class="indent">He gave her a searching glance, hesitated, then
apparently came to an abrupt conclusion.</p>

<p class="indent">"Miss Girard," he said coolly, "your father once
took a good look at me and then made up his mind
about me. And he was not mistaken; I am what he believes
me to be. Now, I also have seen you, and I&#39;ve made
up my mind concerning you. And I don&#39;t expect to be
mistaken. So I say to you frankly I am an enemy to
Germany&mdash;to your country&mdash;and I will not knowingly
aid her&mdash;not to save my own skin or the skins of anybody
else. Tell me then have you any military knowledge
which you intend to impart to your father?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you any suspicion that your maid has been
involved in any such risky business?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have no knowledge of anything military at all. I
don&#39;t believe my maid has, either."</p>

<p class="indent">"You can recall no incident which might lead you to
believe that your maid is engaged in that sort of
affair?"</p>

<p class="indent">The girl was silent. He repeated the question. She
said: "Anna has complained of being followed. I
have already told you that she and I have been annoyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
by impertinent telephone calls and by strange
men coming here. Do you suppose they were from
Scotland Yard?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Possibly. Have you any suspicion why your maid
has been arrested?" he persisted. She hesitated; her
straight brows knitted slightly again as though in a
perplexed effort to remember and to understand. Then
she looked up at Guild out of troubled eyes and shook
her head:</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know&mdash;I don&#39;t <i>know</i>&mdash;whatever my suspicions
may be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Suspicions!"</p>

<p class="indent">"My personal suspicions could scarcely concern you,
Mr. Guild."</p>

<p class="indent">The snub was direct; he reddened.</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well," he said. "What you say gives me a
decent chance for life." He drew a quick breath of relief.
"I&#39;m mighty glad," he said; "I have&mdash;have seen
men die. It isn&#39;t&mdash;an&mdash;agreeable sight. I think we&#39;d
better go."</p>

<p class="indent">"In a moment."</p>

<p class="indent">She took her satchel and went into another room
with it, closing the intervening door. She was gone
only a few seconds. When she returned she had locked
the satchel; he closed and strapped her suit-case and
took it in his hand. Together they descended the stairway
and started through the lower hall.</p>

<p class="indent">And what occurred there happened like lightning.</p>

<p class="indent">For, as he passed the door of the darkened living
room, a man jumped out behind him and threw one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
arm around his throat, and another man stepped in
front of him and snapped a pair of handcuffs on his
wrists.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not even a struggle; Guild was being held too
tightly. The girl shrank back against the wall, flattening
herself against it, staring dumbly at the proceeding
as though stunned. She did not even cry out when the
man who had handcuffed Guild turned on her and
caught her by the elbow.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come along quietly, miss," he began, when suddenly
his voice died out in a groan and he crumpled up on
the floor as Bush, the chauffeur, sprang from the passage-way
behind him and struck him with something
short and heavy.</p>

<p class="indent">The man who had thrown his arm around Guild&#39;s
throat from behind, flung his handcuffed victim aside
and whipped out a revolver, but the chauffeur knocked
it out of his fist and hit him in the face two heavy, merciless
blows, hurling him senseless across the stairs. And
all the while the blond young chauffeur was smiling his
fixed and murderous smile. And he was like a tiger now
in every movement as he knelt, rummaged in the fallen
men&#39;s pockets, found the key to the handcuffs, leaned
over and unlocked them as Guild held out his manacled
hands.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="gs04" id="gs04"></a><img class="border" src="images/gs04.jpg" width="600" height="427" alt="" title=""/>
<p class="caption">"The chauffeur hit him ... two heavy, merciless blows,
hurling him senseless across the stairs"</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">"Please watch them, sir," he said cheerfully. "I
must find a curtain or something&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He ran into the living-room, ripped off a long blue
curtain, tore it into strips with his powerful blond
hands, grinning cheerfully all the while.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
"Best to tie them up, sir&mdash;this way&mdash;allow me, sir&mdash;this
is the better way&mdash;the surer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild, working hard, he scarcely knew why, felt a
touch on his arm.</p>

<p class="indent">"Are they dead?" whispered Karen Girard unsteadily.</p>

<p class="indent">"No&mdash;stunned."</p>

<p class="indent">"Are they robbers?"</p>

<p class="indent">The blond chauffeur looked up, laughed, then rolled
a strip of cloth into a ball for a gag.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m not entirely sure what they are," said Guild.
"I&#39;ll tell you what I think when we&#39;re in the car."</p>

<p class="indent">The chauffeur completed his business, looked over the
results of his efforts critically, rose to his feet, still
smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, sir, if you please&mdash;and madam&mdash;" And he
possessed himself of the luggage.</p>

<p class="indent">"Take the door-key, if you please, sir. Lock it on
the outside. Thank you. This way, if you please, sir.
I took it upon myself to bring the car up to the kitchen
entrance."</p>

<p class="indent">The car stood there; the bags were flung in; Karen
Girard stepped into the tonneau; Guild followed. At
the same moment a woman appeared, coming along the
brick walk.</p>

<p class="indent">"My maid of all work," exclaimed Karen. "What
shall I say to her?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Anything, madam, but send her home," whispered
Bush.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl leaned from the car and called out: "I
have locked the house and am going away for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
day, Mrs. Bulger. Please come tomorrow, as usual."</p>

<p class="indent">The woman thanked her, turned and went away again
down the brick walk. They watched her out of sight.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now!" said Guild to the chauffeur, "drive to the
Holland steamship wharf at&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I know, sir," smiled the blond chauffeur.</p>

<p class="indent">Which reply troubled the young man exceedingly,
for it was evident to him now that, if not herself a spy,
this young girl in his charge was watched, surrounded
and protected by German agents of a sinister sort&mdash;agents
known to her father, in evident communication
with him, and thoroughly informed of the fact that he
wanted his daughter to leave England at once and
under the particular escort of Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor had Guild the slightest doubt that the two men
who had followed and handcuffed him were British Government
agents, and that if this young girl&#39;s maid had
really been arrested for espionage, and if the Edmeston
people, too, were suspected, then suspicion had been
also directed toward Miss Girard and naturally also to
him, who was her visitor.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild&#39;s troubled gaze rested once more upon the
young girl beside him. At the same moment, as though
he had spoken to her she turned and looked at him out
of eyes so honest, so fearless that he had responded
aloud before he realized it: "It&#39;s all right. I know <i>you</i>
are not deceiving me."</p>

<p class="indent">"No," she said, "I am not. But could you tell me
what all this means&mdash;all this that has happened so
swiftly, so terribly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
"I have a pretty clear idea what it means.... It&#39;s
just as well that those detectives did not arrest me....
Tell me, did you ever before see this chauffeur,
Bush?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Never, Mr. Guild."</p>

<p class="indent">He nodded; he was slowly coming to a definite conclusion
concerning the episode but he kept his own counsel.
She said in a low, embarrassed voice: "You think
me cowardly. I know it. But I really didn&#39;t know what
to do."</p>

<p class="indent">She was very much in earnest, very intent on his
expression, and he did not dare smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"What <i>could</i> you have done, Miss Girard?" he asked,
pleasantly.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know. I&mdash;I felt as though we&mdash;you and I&mdash;were
allies&mdash;and that I ought to help you. But it all
passed too quickly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"There was nothing you could have done for me," he
smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">She said reflectively: "I myself don&#39;t quite see how
I could have helped matters. But I didn&#39;t wish you to
believe me afraid to help you."</p>

<p class="indent">He looked into her wistful eyes smilingly: "Somehow,"
he said, "I don&#39;t believe you are really very much
afraid of anything."</p>

<p class="indent">A slight shudder passed over her. "Violence is new
to me. I am not very experienced&mdash;not very old you
know. And I never saw men fight. And when"&mdash;she
lowered her voice&mdash;"when that chauffeur struck them
so heavily&mdash;so dreadfully&mdash;I&mdash;I have never seen men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
fight like that&mdash;strike each other in the face as though
they&mdash;they meant murder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t think of it now, Miss Girard. You must
keep your nerve." He forced a laugh; "you&#39;ll need
all your composure, too, because I&#39;ve got something
to tell you which you won&#39;t like. Shall I tell you
now?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, please."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then&mdash;the man, Grätz, says that you must go
aboard that steamer as my wife."</p>

<p class="indent">The girl looked at him bewildered. "Somebody," continued
Guild, "has taken passage for us as Mr. and Mrs.
Kervyn Guild. Grätz warned me. My name is Kervyn.
Yours is Karen. Our initials are alike. If there is
any suspicion directed toward us there are the initials
on your satchel and suit-case&mdash;and presumably on your
clothing. Do you understand?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you mind?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I mind a little&mdash;yes. But I&#39;ll do what is necessary,"
she said, confused.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think it is necessary. This man Grätz who seems
to know more about my business than I do, tells me so.
I believe he is right."</p>

<p class="indent">She raised her tragic eyes to his but said nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">He leaned nearer to her and spoke in a low voice:</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ve been trying to reason it out," he said, "and
I&#39;ll tell you what my conclusion is: A German automobile
took me to the British lines under a white flag. No
doubt Government agents had been informed by telegraph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
and they followed me as soon as I landed on English
soil.</p>

<p class="indent">"At the Berkeley Hotel I felt very sure that I was
being watched. Now, it appears, that this maid of
yours has been arrested, and, from what I suspect in
regard to the Edmeston Agency&mdash;the agency to which
your father directed me&mdash;I feel very certain that somehow
your maid has been involved in the espionage maintained
here by the German Government.</p>

<p class="indent">"That chauffeur in front of us is from the Edmeston
garage; you see what he did to those two detectives!
It&#39;s very plain to me now that, innocent as you are, you
never will be permitted to leave England, even if they
don&#39;t arrest you, unless you can get out today with
me.</p>

<p class="indent">"And if you don&#39;t leave England it means for me
something very serious. It means that I shall have to
keep my word and go back alone."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know," she nodded, looking up at him very
earnestly.</p>

<p class="indent">He said without the slightest dramatic emphasis: "It
really does mean my death, Miss Girard. I think,
knowing your father, that there could be no possible
hope for me if I go back there without you.... And
so, knowing that, I am naturally most anxious to clear
out of England while I can do so&mdash;get away from here
with you&mdash;if I can take you with a clear conscience.
And"&mdash;he looked at her, "I feel that I can do that because
you have told me that you have gathered no information
for the enemies of England. And"&mdash;he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
smiled&mdash;"to look into your face, Miss Girard, is to
believe you."</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the pretty color faded from her cheeks; she
said: "You asked me if I were a spy. I am not. You
asked me if, knowingly, I carry any military information
which might aid the enemies of England. And I
answered you that, knowingly, I do not carry any such
information."</p>

<p class="indent">"That is sufficient," he concluded, smilingly.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, it is not sufficient," she said. "I wish to say a
little more. Let me go to Trois Fontaines alone. I am
accustomed to travel. There is no need to involve you.
As long as I arrive there what difference does it make
whether or not you accompany me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I promised to accompany you."</p>

<p class="indent">"You promised that I should arrive safely at Trois
Fontaines. It doesn&#39;t matter whether you accompany
me. Please&mdash;please don&#39;t. I had rather you did
not go."</p>

<p class="indent">He said, gravely: "I know how you must feel about
travelling as my wife&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"It isn&#39;t that."</p>

<p class="indent">"What is it then?" he asked, surprised.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t wish you to take the risk of travelling with
me."</p>

<p class="indent">"What risk? The worst that could happen to you
would be your arrest and detention. If you are not a
spy, you can not be proven one."</p>

<p class="indent">Her blue eyes gazed absently out across the sunny
landscape through which they were speeding.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
"You are not a spy," he replied; "what risk do you
run&mdash;or I?"</p>

<p class="indent">She said, still gazing into the sunlit distance: "What
is done to spies&mdash;if they are caught?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It usually means death, Miss Girard."</p>

<p class="indent">"I have&mdash;" she swallowed, caught her breath,
breathed deeply; then&mdash;"I have heard so.... It is
possible that I might be suspected and detained....
I had rather you did not attempt to go with me....
Because&mdash;I do not wish you to get into any difficulty&mdash;on
my&mdash;account."</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing serious could happen to either you or me
through anything that you have done."</p>

<p class="indent">"I am not sure."</p>

<p class="indent">"I am," he said. And added in a lower voice: "It is
very generous of you&mdash;very kind."</p>

<p class="indent">Her own voice was lower still: "Please don&#39;t go with
me, Mr. Guild. Let me go to the wharf alone. Let me
take my chances alone. If there is any difficulty they
will arrest you, too. And if I&mdash;were convicted&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"You could not be. That is utterly impossible.
Don&#39;t think of such things, Miss Girard."</p>

<p class="indent">"I <i>must</i> think of them. Will you tell me something?"
She turned and looked at him curiously, almost wistfully.</p>

<p class="indent">"I want to ask you something. You&mdash;you said to
me that if you thought me a spy, you would not help
me to escape from England. You said so, didn&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean it, don&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
"I am afraid I do."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why? You are not English. You are an American.
America is neutral. Why are you an enemy to
Germany?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t tell you why," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Are</i> you an enemy to Germany?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;a bitter one."</p>

<p class="indent">"And if I were a spy, trying to escape from England&mdash;trying
to escape&mdash;death&mdash;you would refuse to
help me?"</p>

<p class="indent">She had turned entirely toward him on the seat beside
him; her child-like hands clasped on the robe over her
knees, her child-like face, pale, sweet, wistful, turned to
his.</p>

<p class="indent">"Would you abandon me?" she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"The situation is impossible&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, but tell me."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t care to think of such a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Please answer me. Is your partisanship so bitter
that you would wash your hands of me&mdash;let me go to
my death?&mdash;go to your own, too, rather than help me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Miss Girard, you are losing your composure&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No; I am perfectly composed. But I should like
to know what you would do under such circumstances
with a girl nineteen years old who stood in danger of
death."</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t tell you," he said, perplexed and impatient.
"I can&#39;t tell now what I might do."</p>

<p class="indent">"Would you denounce me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, of course not."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
"Would you feel&mdash;sorry?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Sorry!" He looked at her; "I should think I
would!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Sorry enough for me to help me get away?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Even if I carried military information to Germany?"</p>

<p class="indent">He looked into her eyes searchingly for a moment.
"Yes," he said; "I&#39;d do what I could for you to get you
out of England."</p>

<p class="indent">"Even if I had lied to you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You couldn&#39;t lie to anybody."</p>

<p class="indent">"But if I could? If I have lied and you found it
out, would you still try to help me to get away?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You are asking something that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, you can answer it. You can think a while first
and then answer. I want you to answer. I want to
know what you&#39;d do with me."</p>

<p class="indent">"You make it a personal matter?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. I don&#39;t want to know what you&#39;d do in theory;
I wish you to tell me what you, personally, would do
with me, Karen Girard, if you believed me to be a spy,
and if you came to the conclusion that I had lied to
you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why do you ask all this? You are over-wrought,
unstrung&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I am absolutely mistress of myself. And I wish to
know what you would do with <i>me</i>? Would you let me
die?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;d stand by me still?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
"Yes. There&#39;s no use mincing matters. Yes, I
would."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;d help me to leave England?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">There fell a silence between them, and his face slowly
reddened.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am not sure why," he said slowly.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am. Shall I tell you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, tell me," he said, forcing himself to meet her
clear gaze.</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well, I&#39;ll tell you. It is because we are friends.
And that is the real truth. I realize it. From the very
beginning it was a friendship, without effort, instantly
and mutually understood. Is it not true?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"And that&mdash;the instant liking&mdash;was the basis for our
confidence in each other. Was it not?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It must have been. I trusted you without hesitation."</p>

<p class="indent">"And I you.... And I did tell you the truth....
But not all of it."</p>

<p class="indent">"What have you left untold?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Enough to&mdash;to frighten me&mdash;a little. I am beginning
to be afraid&mdash;just enough afraid to feel troubled&mdash;rather
deeply troubled about&mdash;you."</p>

<p class="indent">"About <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because&mdash;we are friends. I don&#39;t understand how it
has happened so quickly. But it has happened to us&mdash;hasn&#39;t
it?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
"Yes," he said, "it has. I&mdash;I am already&mdash;devoted
to&mdash;our friendship."</p>

<p class="indent">"I am, too. It seems odd, doesn&#39;t it. I have had no
friends among men. This is new to me. I don&#39;t know
what to do about it. I want to be so loyal about it&mdash;I
wish to be what a man&mdash;such a man as you are&mdash;desires
of a friend&mdash;what he requires of friendship....
<i>Do</i> you understand? I am really a trifle bewildered&mdash;with
the surprise and pleasure of friendship&mdash;and with
its obligations.... But I am very sure that unselfishness
is one of its obligations and that truth is another."</p>

<p class="indent">"Both are part of you."</p>

<p class="indent">"They seem to be now. And so&mdash;because we are
friends&mdash;don&#39;t go to the wharf with me. Because I
think I may be&mdash;arrested. And if I am&mdash;it may go
hard with me."</p>

<p class="indent">She said it so gently, and her eyes were so clear and
sweet that for a moment he did not grasp the subtler
significance of her appeal.</p>

<p class="indent">"You <i>can&#39;t</i> be involved seriously," he insisted.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m afraid it is possible."</p>

<p class="indent">"How?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I can only guess how. I may be wrong. But I
dare not risk involving you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Can&#39;t you tell me a little more?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Please don&#39;t ask."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well. But I shall not leave you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Please."</p>

<p class="indent">"No. You ask too little of friendship."</p>

<p class="indent">"I do not wish to ask too much. Let me get clear of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
this affair if I can. If I can&#39;t&mdash;let me at least remember
that I have not involved you in my&mdash;ruin."</p>

<p class="indent">"Your ruin!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. It may come to that. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t
know exactly what all this tangle means&mdash;what really
threatens me, what I have to dread. But I am afraid&mdash;afraid!"
Her voice became unsteady for a moment
and she stared straight ahead of her at the yellow haze
which loomed nearer and nearer above the suburbs of
London.</p>

<p class="indent">He slipped one arm under hers, quietly, and his hand
fell over both of hers, where they rested clasped tightly
on her lap.</p>

<p class="indent">"This won&#39;t do," he said coolly. "You are not to
be frightened whatever happens. We must go through
with this affair, you and I. I know you have plenty of
courage."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;except about you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I stand or fall with you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Please, you must not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I must and shall. Within the next few minutes you
must regain your composure and self-command. Will
you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Because our safety may depend on your coolness."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you remember that we are married?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Will it be difficult for you to carry out that rôle?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;don&#39;t know what to do. Could you tell me?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
"Yes. If you speak to me call me by my first name.
Do you remember it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">"You won&#39;t forget?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"I think you had better say &#39;no, dear.&#39; Try it."</p>

<p class="indent">"No&mdash;dear."</p>

<p class="indent">"Try it again."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, dear."</p>

<p class="indent">"Letter perfect," he said, trying to speak lightly.
"You see you look about seventeen, and it&#39;s plain we
couldn&#39;t have been married very long. So it&#39;s safer to
say &#39;yes, dear,&#39; and &#39;no, dear,&#39; every time. You won&#39;t
forget, Karen, will you?"</p>

<p class="indent">She flushed a trifle when her name fell from his lips.
"No, dear," she said in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"And if anybody addresses you as Mrs. Guild&mdash;will
you try to be prepared?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;dear. Yes, I will&mdash;Kervyn."</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed a trifle excitedly. "You are perfect&mdash;and
really adorable in the part," he said. And his
nervous excitement in the imminence of mutual danger
subtly excited her.</p>

<p class="indent">"I ought to do it well," she said; "I have studied
dramatic art and I have had some stage experience.
It&#39;s a part and I <i>must</i> do it well. I shall, really&mdash;Kervyn,
dear."</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed; the dangerous game was beginning to
exhilarate them both, and a vivid colour began to burn
in her delicate cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
Suddenly the blond chauffeur pulled the car up along
the curb in a crowded street and stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">"It is better, sir, to take a hansom from here to the
wharf."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you think so?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir.... Pardon, sir, here are passports
for madam and yourself." And he handed the papers
very coolly to Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">The young man changed colour, realizing instantly
that the papers were forged.</p>

<p class="indent">"Had I better take these?" he asked under his breath.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir," said Bush, smiling his eternal smile and
opening the car door for them.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild descended. Bush set the luggage on the curb,
touched his cap, and said: "Walk south, sir, until a
cabby hails you. Good-bye, sir. A pleasant trip,
madam." And he sprang back into the car, started it,
and rolled away grinning from ear to ear.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild took the luggage in both hands; Karen walked
beside him. At the end of the square the driver of a
hansom held up one hand inquiringly, then smiled and
drew in to the curb.</p>

<p class="indent">"Fresh Wharf, sir?" asked the cabby.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," said Guild, calmly, red with surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks, sir. I understand all about it."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE SATCHEL</h3>

<p class="indent">It was only a short drive to Fresh Wharf by London
Bridge. A marching column of kilted Territorials
checked them for a while and they looked
on while the advanced guard of civilians surged by, followed
by pipers and then by the long leaf-brown column
at a smart swinging stride.</p>

<p class="indent">When the troops had passed the hansom moved on
very slowly through the human flotsam still eddying in
the wake of the regiment; and after a few more minutes
it pulled up again and Guild sprang out, lifted the
young girl to the sidewalk, and handed the fare to the
driver.</p>

<p class="indent">The latter leaned over and as he took the coins he
thrust a parcel into Guild&#39;s hands. "Your change, sir,"
he said genially, touched his top hat and drove off, looking
right and left for another fare.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild&#39;s surprised eyes fell on the packet. It contained
two steamer tickets strapped together by a rubber
band.</p>

<p class="indent">Pushing through the throng where policemen, wharf
officials and soldiers in khaki were as numerous as civilians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
Guild finally signalled a porter to take the luggage
aboard. Karen retained her satchel. A brief
scrutiny of his tickets detained them for a moment, then
the porter led them up the gang-plank and aboard and
a steward directed them to their stateroom. At the
same moment a uniformed official stepped up to Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sorry to trouble you, sir," he said politely, "but
may I have your name?"</p>

<p class="indent">"My name is Kervyn Guild."</p>

<p class="indent">The official glanced over the steamer list. "You have
papers of identification, Mr. Guild?"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild handed him his forged passports. The official
took them, glanced at Karen, at the luggage which the
porter bore.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where do you go from Amsterdam, Mr. Guild?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Through Holland."</p>

<p class="indent">"Naturally. And then?"</p>

<p class="indent">"To the Grand Duchy."</p>

<p class="indent">"Luxembourg?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Where in Luxembourg?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have been invited to visit friends."</p>

<p class="indent">"Where?"</p>

<p class="indent">"At Lesse Forest."</p>

<p class="indent">"Where is that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Partly in the Duchy, partly in Belgium."</p>

<p class="indent">"Who are your friends?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Mrs. and Miss Courland of New York and a Mr.
Darrel."</p>

<p class="indent">"Madam goes with you?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">The official began to unfold the passports, while he
looked sideways at the luggage. Holding the passports
partly open in one hand he pointed to Karen&#39;s satchel
with the other.</p>

<p class="indent">"Please open that," he said, and began to examine
the passports. A deadly pallour came over the girl&#39;s
face; she did not stir. Guild turned to glance at her
and was stricken dumb. But she found her speech.
"Dear," she said, with white lips, "would you mind
stepping ashore and getting me something at a chemist&#39;s?"
And under her breath, pressing close to him:
"Go, for God&#39;s sake. I am afraid I shall be arrested."
A terrible fear struck through him.</p>

<p class="indent">"The satchel!" he motioned with his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. Go while you can. Go&mdash;go&mdash;dear."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll be back in a moment, Karen," he said, coolly
took the satchel from the porter, turned with it toward
the gang-plank.</p>

<p class="indent">The official raised his eyes from the passport he was
scanning.</p>

<p class="indent">"One moment, sir," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll be back directly," returned Guild, continuing on
his way.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where are you going, Mr. Guild?"</p>

<p class="indent">"To a chemist&#39;s."</p>

<p class="indent">"Be kind enough to leave that satchel and remain
here until I have finished," said the official coldly. And
to Karen: "Mrs. Guild, will you kindly open that bag?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Certainly. I have the key somewhere"&mdash;searching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
in her reticule. And as she searched she lifted her eyes
to Guild. Her face was dead white.</p>

<p class="indent">"Dearest," she said in a steady voice, "will you go
to the chemist&#39;s while I am opening my bag. I <i>must</i>
have something for this headache."</p>

<p class="indent">Her agonized eyes said: "Save yourself while you
can; I am caught!"</p>

<p class="indent">But Guild turned and came back to her, close, standing
beside her.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll open the luggage," he said quietly. "You had
better step ashore and get what you need." And, in a
whisper: "Go straight to the American Ambassador and
tell him everything."</p>

<p class="indent">She whispered: "No; I beg of you go. I beg of you,
Kervyn."</p>

<p class="indent">He shook his head and they stood there together; he
grave and silent, assailed by a terrible premonition; she
white as death, mechanically fumbling in her reticule
with slim, childish fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">The official was deeply immersed in the passports and
continued so even when Karen&#39;s tremulous fingers held
the key. "Give it to me," whispered Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"No&mdash;" She beckoned the porter, took the satchel,
and at the same moment the official looked up at her,
then holding both passports, came over to where they
were standing.</p>

<p class="indent">"Your papers are in order, Mr. Guild," he said.
"Now, Mrs. Guild, if you will open your satchel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll attend to that, Holden," broke in a careless
voice, and the satchel was taken out of Karen&#39;s hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
by a short, dark young man in uniform. "I want you
to go forward and look at a gentleman for The Hague
who has no papers. He&#39;s listed as Begley. Do you
mind?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Right," said Holden. "Here, Mitchell, these papers
are satisfactory. Look over Mr. Guild&#39;s luggage and
come forward when you&#39;re finished. What&#39;s his name?
Begley?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, American. I&#39;ll be with you in a moment."</p>

<p class="indent">Holden hastened forward; Mitchell looked after him
for a moment, then calmly handed back the unopened
satchel to Karen and while she held it he made a mark
on it with a bit of chalk.</p>

<p class="indent">"I pass your luggage," he said in a low voice, stooping
and marking the suit-case and Guild&#39;s sack. "You
have nothing to fear at Amsterdam, but there are spies
on this steamer. Best go to your cabin and stay there
until the boat docks."</p>

<p class="indent">The girl bent her little head in silence; the porter
resumed the luggage and piloted them aft through an
ill-lighted corridor. When he came to the door of their
cabin he called a steward, took his tip from Guild,
touched his cap and went away.</p>

<p class="indent">The steward opened the stateroom door for them,
set the luggage on the lounge, asked if there was anything
more he could do, was told that there was not, and
took himself off.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild locked the door after him, turned and looked
down at the girl, who had sunk trembling upon the
lounge.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
"What is there in that satchel?" he asked coldly.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know."</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>What!</i>" he said in a contemptuous voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn&mdash;my friend&mdash;I do not know," she stammered.</p>

<p class="indent">"You <i>must</i> know! You packed it!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. But I do not know. Can&#39;t you believe me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"How can I? You know what you put into that
satchel, don&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;put in toilet articles&mdash;night clothes&mdash;money."</p>

<p class="indent">"What else? You put in something else, didn&#39;t you?
Something that has made you horribly afraid!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"What is it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn&mdash;I don&#39;t <i>know</i> what it is. I must not know.
It is a matter of honour."</p>

<p class="indent">"If you don&#39;t know what it is you carry in that
satchel you evidently suspect what it might prove to
be."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"You have very strong suspicions?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I have."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why did you take such a thing?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I promised."</p>

<p class="indent">"Whom?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t tell you. It is a matter of honour. I&mdash;I
didn&#39;t want to involve you if things turned badly. I
asked you to leave me.... Even at the last moment
I tried to give you a chance to go ashore and escape.
Kervyn, I&#39;ve tried to be honourable and to be loyal to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
you at the same time. I&#39;ve tried&mdash;I&#39;ve tried&mdash;" Her
childish voice faltered, almost broke, and she turned her
head sharply away from him.</p>

<p class="indent">He dropped onto the lounge beside her, sick with
anxiety, and laid his hand over hers where it lay in her
lap.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m afraid that you have papers in that satchel
which might mean the end of the world for you," he
said under his breath. "God alone knows why you carry
them if you suspect their contents.... Well, I won&#39;t
ask you anything more at present.... If your conscience
acquits you, I do. I do anyway. You have
given me plenty of chances to escape. You have been
very plucky, very generous to me, Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">"I have tried to be," she said unsteadily. "You have
been far too kind to me, Kervyn.... I&mdash;I don&#39;t mean
to tremble so. I think I am, feeling the&mdash;the reaction."</p>

<p class="indent">"Lie down. I am afraid I&#39;ll have to stay here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; don&#39;t go out on deck. Don&#39;t take any more
risks.... I&#39;ll lie down if I may." She rose, looked
around with eyes still darkly dilated by fear:</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh!" she breathed&mdash;"if we were only out of British
waters!"</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at his watch, and at the same moment a
deep blast from the steamer vibrated through the cabin.</p>

<p class="indent">"They&#39;ve cast off," he said calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl had flung herself on the bed and buried her
face in the pillow. Her brown velvet hat had fallen
to the floor, her thick brown hair clustered in glossy
disorder over neck and cheek. One slim hand clutched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
convulsively a tiny handkerchief crushed into a ball.</p>

<p class="indent">"We have every chance now," he said very gently,
bending over the pillow&mdash;"barring a wireless to some
British guard-ship. Don&#39;t give way yet, Karen." He
laid a cool, firm hand over hers and tried to speak jestingly.
"Wait until there&#39;s no danger at all before you
go all to pieces," he whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">As he bent above her, he became conscious of the
warm fragrance of tears. But no sound came, not a
quiver. And after a while he went over to the sofa and
sat down, staring at the locked satchel on the floor,
vaguely aware that the boat was in steady motion.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen," he said after a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;dear."</p>

<p class="indent">"You know," he said, forcing a laugh, "you needn&#39;t
say it when we&#39;re alone&mdash;except for practice."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, dear, I know."</p>

<p class="indent">"May I ask you something?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, please."</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you know that official named Mitchell?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Who was he?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Grätz."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>AT SEA</h3>

<p class="indent">The funnel smoke blew low, burying the afterdecks,
and a hurricane of scud and spindrift
swept everything forward, drenching the
plunging steamer to the bridge. Stanchions, davits,
hatches were all a-dip, decks a-wash, and the Dutch ensign
whipping aloft in a thick grey sky that seemed
to speed astern as though in chase of the heaving grey
waste of waters that fled away beneath.</p>

<p class="indent">Here and there a trawler tossed and rocked; lean,
melancholy wanderers on the face of the waters; twice
the raking stacks of destroyers, smothered in foam,
dashed eastward running full speed on some occult trail
twixt sky and sea.</p>

<p class="indent">The grey world grew duller, duller; one by one the
blinding searchlights on coast-guard ships broke out,
sweeping sky and ocean as though in desperate appeal
to the God above and in menacing warning to the devils
that lurked below.</p>

<p class="indent">For they said the North Sea was full of them; legions
of them tossed broadcast from the black hell of some
human mind. And beneath them, deeper, lying as still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
as death on the Channel&#39;s floor, waited the human submarines
in unseen watery depths&mdash;motionless, patient,
awaiting the moment to strike.</p>

<p class="indent">Night came; the white level glare of searchlights
flooded the steamer, lingered, shifted, tossed their dazzling
arms heavenward as though imploring the Most
High, then swept unseen horizons where the outermost
waters curve with the curving globe.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Only one light burned in the stateroom, but the port
was not covered.</p>

<p class="indent">Karen lay on the bed, unstirring save for a slight
tremor of her shoulders now and then. Her brown hair,
half loosened, had fallen in thick burnished curls on
the pillow; one hand covered her eyes, palm outward.
Under it the vivid lips, scarcely parted, rested on each
other in a troubled curve.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild brooded silently on the lounge under the port.
Sometimes his sombre gaze rested on her, sometimes on
the locked satchel which had rolled to the side of the
bed.</p>

<p class="indent">Every time the arrowy beam of light from a warship
flooded the cabin with swift white splendour his
heart seemed to stop, for the menace of the wireless was
always a living dread; and the stopping of a neutral
ship and the taking from it of suspects had become a
practice too common even to excite comment, let alone
protest.</p>

<p class="indent">Twice they were stopped; twice Ardoise signals
twinkled; but no cutter came alongside, and no officer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
boarded them. It was an eternity of suspense to Guild,
and he stood by the open port, listening, the satchel
in his hand ready to fling it out into the turmoil of
heaving waters.</p>

<p class="indent">The steward came, and Guild ordered something
served for them both in the stateroom. Karen had not
awakened, but her hand had slipped from her eyes
and it lay across the edge of the bed.</p>

<p class="indent">On the bridal finger glimmered the plain gold band&mdash;his
credentials to her from her father.</p>

<p class="indent">He went over and looked down into the white, childish
face. Faultless, serene, wonderful as a flower it
seemed to him. Where the black lashes rested the curve
of the cheek was faintly tinted with colour. All else
was snowy save for the vivid rose of the scarcely
parted lips.</p>

<p class="indent">Nineteen!&mdash;and all those accomplishments which her
dim living-room at Westheath had partly revealed&mdash;where
books in many languages had silently exposed
the mind that required them&mdash;where pictures, music&mdash;all
the unstudied and charming disorder of this young
girl&#39;s intimate habitation had delicately revealed its
tenant.</p>

<p class="indent">And what her living-room had foreshadowed was
only, after all, but a tinted phantom of the girl he had
come to know in the flesh&mdash;the real mistress of that
dim room quickened to life&mdash;a warm, living, breathing
reality, low-voiced, blue-eyed, winsome and sweet with
the vague fragrance of youth incarnate clinging to her,
to every gesture, every movement, every turn of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
head&mdash;to her very skirts it seemed&mdash;youth, freshness,
purity unblemished.</p>

<p class="indent">As he stood there he tried to realize that she was
German&mdash;this young girl with her low and charming
English voice and her accentless English speech.</p>

<p class="indent">He had listened in vain for any flaw, any indication
of alien birth. Nothing betrayed her as a foreigner,
except, possibly, a delightfully quaint formality in accepting
any service offered. For when he asked her
whether she desired this or that, or if he might do this
or that for her, always her answer in the affirmative
was, "Yes, please," like a little girl who had been carefully
taught to respect age. It amused him; for modern
English young women are less punctilious with
modern youth.</p>

<p class="indent">There came a dull clatter of crockery from the passageway;
Guild turned and opened the door. The
waiter produced a folding table, spread it, and arranged
the dishes.</p>

<p class="indent">"That will be all," whispered Guild. "Don&#39;t knock
again; I&#39;ll set the tray outside."</p>

<p class="indent">So the waiter went away and Guild closed the door
again and turned back to the bed where Karen lay.
Her delicate brows were now slightly knitted and the
troubled curve of her lips hinted again of a slumber
not wholly undisturbed by subconscious apprehension.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen," he said in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl opened her eyes. They had that starry
freshness that one sees in the eyes of waking children.
For a moment her confused gaze met his without expression,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
then a hot flush stained her face and she sat
up hurriedly. Down tumbled the thick, burnished locks
and her hands flew instinctively to twist them up.</p>

<p class="indent">"I didn&#39;t realize that I had been asleep. Please, will
you turn your back"&mdash;her glance fell on the table&mdash;"I
shall be ready in a moment&mdash;Kervyn."</p>

<p class="indent">"Had I not better give you the place to yourself?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, please."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll do a sentry-go in the corridor," he said. "Open
the door when you&#39;re quite ready."</p>

<p class="indent">So he went out and walked up and down until the
stateroom door opened and her low voice summoned
him.</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t eat," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you feel the sea?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No"&mdash;she smiled faintly&mdash;"but the excitement of
the day&mdash;the anxiety&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"We&#39;ll have some tea, anyway," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">They ate a little after all, and the hot and rather
vile tea stimulated her. Presently he set tray and table
outside in the corridor and came slowly back to where
she had gathered herself in a corner of the sofa.</p>

<p class="indent">"The sea is rather rough," he said. "You seem to
be a good sailor."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I am. My father had a yacht and my mother
and I always went when he cruised."</p>

<p class="indent">This slightest glimpse of personal history&mdash;the first
she had vouchsafed&mdash;the first slight lifting of the
curtain which hung between them, aroused his latent
curiosity.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
What else lay behind that delicate, opaque veil which
covered the nineteen years of her? What had been the
childhood, the earlier life of this young girl whom he
had found living alone with a maid and a single servant
at an obscure heath outside of London?</p>

<p class="indent">Gently born, gently bred young girls of aristocratic
precedents, don&#39;t do that sort of thing. Even if they
desire to try it, they are not permitted. Also they
don&#39;t go on the stage, as a rule.</p>

<p class="indent">Neither the sign manual, the sign visible of the theatre,
nor yet that occult indefinable something characteristic
of the footlights appeared to taint her personality.</p>

<p class="indent">Talented as she was undoubtedly, cultured and gently
nurtured, the sum total of all her experience, her
schooling, her development, and her art had resulted
only in a charming harmony, not a personality aggressively
accented in any single particular. Any drawing-room
in any country might have contained this young
girl. Homes which possess drawing-rooms breed the
self-possession, the serenity, the soft voice, the winsome
candour and directness of such girls as she.</p>

<p class="indent">She was curled up in the corner of the sofa where
he had placed behind her the two pillows from the bed,
and her winning blue eyes rested every few minutes
upon this young man whom she had known only a few
hours and whom she already, in her heart and in her
mind, was calling a friend.</p>

<p class="indent">She had never had any among young men&mdash;never
even among older men had she experienced the quiet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
security, the untroubled certainty of such a friendship
as had begun now&mdash;as had suddenly stepped into her
life, new, yet strangely familiar&mdash;a friendship that
seemed instantly fully developed and satisfactory.</p>

<p class="indent">There appeared to be no room for doubt about it,
no occasion for waiting, no uncertainty in her mind,
no inclination and no thought of the lesser conventionalities
which must strew elaborately the path of first
acquaintance with the old, old-fashioned garlands&mdash;those
prim, stiff blossoms of discretion, of propriety,
of self-conscious concession to formula and tradition.</p>

<p class="indent">No; when her eyes first fell on him her mind and
heart seemed to recognize what neither had ever before
beheld&mdash;a friend. And from that moment the girl
had accepted the matter as settled, as far as she herself
was concerned. And she had lost very little time
in acquainting herself with his views upon the subject.</p>

<p class="indent">That he had responded to the friendship she had so
naïvely offered did not surprise her. She seemed to
have expected it&mdash;perhaps in the peril of the moments
when they were nearing London and doubt and suspicion
in her mind concerning the contents of her satchel
were becoming an agony to her as they grew more definite&mdash;perhaps
even then the sudden and deep sense of
gratitude for his response had made courage a new necessity
and had armoured her against panic&mdash;for friendship&#39;s
sake.</p>

<p class="indent">All she realized in that moment was that this friendship,
so sudden, so vital, was already so strong in her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
so real, that even in the terror of that instant she
thought of the danger to him, and asked him to let
her go on alone.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps they both were thinking of these things&mdash;she,
curled up in her corner, looking thoughtfully at
him; he, knees crossed, gazing restlessly from object
to object in the unsteady stateroom, but his eyes always
reverting to her.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the duet of silence ended for a while. He said:
"You must not suppose that I am not keenly alive to
the kindness, the fearless generosity you have shown
me all through this affair. What you suffered is lodged
forever in my mind&mdash;and in my heart."</p>

<p class="indent">"What you have done for me is in my&mdash;heart," she
said in her sweetly modulated voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have done very little&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"You would not leave me!"</p>

<p class="indent">"My own life was forfeit if I did&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No! You did not reason that way! Besides, had I
managed to get through alone, you should have had
your life back again to do with as you pleased. No;
you did not reason that way. You stood by a friend
in peril&mdash;at your own peril."</p>

<p class="indent">She drew a deep, tremulous breath. "More than
that," she said, "you stood by me when you almost believed
I had lied to you&mdash;lied shamefully."</p>

<p class="indent">"I had my plans ready&mdash;in that event," he said,
forcing a laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">"You <i>did</i> doubt me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
She bent her head, looked thoughtfully at her hands,
which clasped one knee, then, lifting her eyes: "I forgive
you," she said gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">He flushed: "I did not know you&mdash;did not realize&mdash;what
you are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"You were slower than I."</p>

<p class="indent">"What?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I trusted <i>you</i>&mdash;from the first."</p>

<p class="indent">He was silent; she watched him for a few moments,
then:</p>

<p class="indent">"When you concluded that I had lied to you, what
plans had you ready?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I had rather not say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Please do."</p>

<p class="indent">He bit his lip: "I had decided to take your satchel
from you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Against my wishes?" she asked, amazed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">There was no resentment, only a childish surprise:
"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I told you that I am an enemy to your country."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I told you that I would not knowingly permit you
to take out of England anything which might be detrimental
to England&#39;s interests. And I made up my
mind that if you had deceived me&mdash;and although I
stood by you&mdash;because you are only a young girl&mdash;and
were in danger from those who make no allowance
for youth and sex&mdash;nevertheless, as soon as you were
in personal safety, I meant to take from you whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
you had concealed from me and which might have been
of service to England&#39;s enemies."</p>

<p class="indent">"Would you have done that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, if you had been untruthful to me."</p>

<p class="indent">She bent her head, thoughtfully; then looking up at
him: "Yes; that would have been just.... But I have
not been untruthful."</p>

<p class="indent">His perplexed and slightly careworn eyes met hers.</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t doubt you," he said. "I know you have
been truthful. But&mdash;what <i>is</i> in that satchel? Forgive
me, I <i>must</i> ask you. Because there is evidently enough
there to terrify you at the thought of British eyes inspecting
it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn&mdash;can&#39;t you believe me when I tell you that
I don&#39;t <i>know</i> what is in that satchel?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I <i>do</i> believe you. But tell me what you are afraid
it might be."</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t&mdash;truly I can&#39;t tell you. Don&#39;t you understand?
Don&#39;t you realize that I must have promised?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Promised?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;not to unlock or open the satchel. I <i>did</i>
promise."</p>

<p class="indent">"To whom did you make that promise?" And, as
she did not reply: "Was the promise made to anybody
I ever met?"</p>

<p class="indent">She looked at him in a distressed way, but his face
darkened and his determination increased.</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you make that promise to a German? An
officer? Did you make it to General von Reiter?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
"I see. And there <i>are</i> papers in that satchel!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Where did you get them?"</p>

<p class="indent">"From&mdash;Mr. Grätz."</p>

<p class="indent">"You were accustomed to receive papers from Mr.
Grätz?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Sometimes."</p>

<p class="indent">"At certain intervals?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know. Whenever Mr. Grätz telephoned,
Anna, my maid, went to London and usually brought
back the&mdash;the plans."</p>

<p class="indent">"Plans!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. I understood that they were plans of a new
automobile which was being designed by the Edmeston
Agency for their Berlin branch. Mr. Grätz mentioned
it as the Bauer-Schroeder car."</p>

<p class="indent">"To whom were these plans to go, ultimately?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I sent them to New York."</p>

<p class="indent">"To whom?"</p>

<p class="indent">"To Schimmel and Company, Broadway."</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you any idea where Schimmel and Company
sent those plans?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. I never thought much about it then, but today
I realized that sooner or later the plans were sent
to General von Reiter&mdash;in Berlin."</p>

<p class="indent">"You are sure?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. I saw them when I was there last April. He
said that those were the plans which I had sent to
Schimmel and Company."</p>

<p class="indent">"You <i>saw</i> the plans?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Were they plans of an automobile?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;thought so then. They were on very thin paper.
I supposed them to be drawings of detached machinery
in sections. They looked to me like fragments of
something."</p>

<p class="indent">"And now&mdash;in the light of what happened today&mdash;what
do you believe those drawings represented?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have no idea&mdash;really I haven&#39;t. Only&mdash;" She
hesitated, troubled, twisting her fingers on her knees.</p>

<p class="indent">"Only&mdash;" he prompted her.</p>

<p class="indent">She said, with a tremulous intake of breath: "I
think I had better tell you, Kervyn. This is what
frightened me&mdash;what the experience of today seemed
to suddenly make plain to me&mdash;I mean your coming
to Westheath, Mr. Grätz telephoning about obeying
you, and informing me of the arrest of my maid&mdash;these
things, and the war, and what I have read about
German spies in England&mdash;all this flashed up in my
mind at the same time when you turned from the telephone
and asked me such terrible questions.</p>

<p class="indent">"It made clear to me, or seemed to, something else
that I had not understood at the time&mdash;" She hesitated,
her gaze concentrated as though in an effort to
recollect and visualize some scene&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"It was last April, in Berlin.... General Baron
von Reiter said something to me as I was waiting for
his car to take me to the station&mdash;I was departing for
England again&mdash;and he said&mdash;he said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
"He said something about war&mdash;the possibility of it.
And he said that in case war ever came while I was in
England, and if, when it came, I had in my possession
any automobile plans from the Edmeston Agency&mdash;from
Mr. Grätz&mdash;that I was to bring them with me
to Germany&mdash;not to show them to anybody, not to send
them by mail, but to bring them back and deliver them
to him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">"I promised.... He made me promise again. He
was very serious. He said that on my obedience in
this matter might depend the lives of many people. I
had no idea what he meant by that&mdash;until today....
And what I fear has happened is that Anna, who went
yesterday to London because Mr. Grätz telephoned,
was arrested while in possession of papers delivered to
her by Mr. Grätz.... And that these papers were
<i>not</i> what I had always supposed. And that is why I
was suddenly afraid&mdash;afraid&mdash;Oh, Kervyn!&mdash;I cannot
describe the fear that leaped up and seized me when
you asked me those dreadful questions! Suddenly
everything, every detail in the entire matter seemed to
grow clear and terrible to me.... I&mdash;I went into my
dressing-room&mdash;and steadied myself against the wall&mdash;feeling
faint for a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then I took from my dressing-table the papers
which I had from Anna&#39;s last visit to Mr. Grätz. They
had remained there in the drawer because I had been
told not to mail them, and no word had come for me
to go back to Berlin. So I had them on my hands.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
But until you came I gave them no thought&mdash;merely
conscious that I had promised to take them back
with me.</p>

<p class="indent">"But&mdash;in that terrible moment when I stood there
leaning against the wall, I remembered what was said
to me about the lives of many people depending upon
my keeping my promise. It was a hideous thing to
remember at such a time.... But I could not break
my word&mdash;for the sake of these imperilled people also&mdash;could
I, Kervyn?... So I took the papers and
locked them in my satchel. And afterward I&mdash;I <i>asked</i>
you to leave&mdash;" Her voice quivered; she bent her head
and sat twisting her slim fingers on her lap.</p>

<p class="indent">"That is all I know," she faltered&mdash;"all I know
about it. I have tried to be true to my word, and loyal
to&mdash;you."</p>

<p class="indent">Her emotion was reflected in his own face; he bent
forward, laid his hand over her restless fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen," he said, "you are the pluckiest, straightest,
whitest woman I ever knew."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m only&mdash;honest," she whispered.... "And I
want you to think me so."</p>

<p class="indent">"I do!&mdash;Karen, dearest, sincerest, most fearless of
women!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you believe me&mdash;that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">A sharp knocking at the door cut him short. They
looked at each other, startled. At the same moment
he realized that the ship had stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">"Could it be the stewardess?" she whispered.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
"I don&#39;t know."</p>

<p class="indent">He rose, picked up the satchel and went to the open
port.</p>

<p class="indent">"If a British guard-ship has stopped us to search
us, we can&#39;t have this thing found," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">She stared at him in frightened silence.</p>

<p class="indent">"They may have found those men we tied up and
left in your house at Westheath!" he whispered. "A
wireless would set a score of warships ready to intercept
us. If they board us they must not find that
satchel."</p>

<p class="indent">The sharp, loud rapping came again.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild went to the open port, pushed the satchel
through it, leaned out himself. As he did so something
brushed his head, and, looking up, he saw a rope&#39;s end
dangling there.</p>

<p class="indent">In an instant he had tied it to the handle of the
satchel, stepped back, screwed the heavy glass fast, and
then, motioning Karen to fling herself on the bed, he
went to the door, opened it, and stood yawning in the
face of a ship&#39;s officer.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t wake my wife," he said drowsily. "What is
the trouble?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The trouble is," replied the officer coldly, "that a
British cruiser has signalled us to stop, and has asked
whether an American named Guild is aboard."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>H. M. S. WYVERN</h3>

<p class="indent">"Well," said Guild coolly, "have you any idea
what a casual British cruiser might want of
<i>me</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have not," said the officer, "so perhaps you had
better tell <i>me</i> what is wanted of yourself and your wife
by the captain of that warship. It might save some
argument between him and our own captain. We are
due in Amsterdam at noon tomorrow," he added meaningly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you mean to say that the officer in command of
this British ship desires to speak to my wife?"</p>

<p class="indent">"His signals stopped us and his wireless told us to
detain you and your wife."</p>

<p class="indent">"What ship is it?" demanded the young man, so
nervous now that he scarcely knew what he was saying.</p>

<p class="indent">The Dutch officer remained icy and precise: "The
ship is the light cruiser <i>Wyvern</i>, of the &#39;Monster&#39; class.
Her consorts yonder are the <i>Hippogriff</i> and <i>Basalisk</i>&mdash;if
this information enlightens you, Mr. Guild."</p>

<p class="indent">"It does not. But I know this much: You can&#39;t detain
an American! Neither can that British captain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
take a neutral from a neutral ship! And that settles
the matter."</p>

<p class="indent">"Be good enough to come on deck," said the Hollander
in his correct and fluent English. "The captain
desires to speak with you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well. I&#39;ll follow you in a moment"&mdash;and turning
to Karen: "Dearest, are you awake?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, dear."</p>

<p class="indent">"The captain wishes to see me. I&#39;ll be back directly."
He stepped out into the corridor, hesitated,
excused himself to the officer, and returned to Karen,
closing the door and locking it.</p>

<p class="indent">She was sitting up on the bed, very still and white,
and when he came over to her she instinctively laid
both chilled hands in his. He held them in a firm and
reassuring clasp; but he was terribly disconcerted.</p>

<p class="indent">"Listen, dear. I think a British officer is coming
aboard for us. I don&#39;t know whether he has any right
to take us off this ship, but I&#39;m afraid that the law in
the matter won&#39;t worry him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now listen to me, dear. If I come back and knock
and call to you by name, open. If somebody knocks,
and there is no voice&mdash;or if it is not my voice, go to
that port, open it, untie your satchel, which is hanging
outside at a rope&#39;s end, take out the papers, and drop
them into the sea. And not until you have done this
shall you open the door to anybody."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, Kervyn."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then," he said, "if we&#39;ve got to go back to England
on a warship, we&#39;ll go clean-handed."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"And you had better take these passports, too." He
drew them from his breast pocket. "They&#39;re forged.
Throw them out with the other papers."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I will."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then&mdash;I&#39;m going.... Don&#39;t worry&mdash;dear. Don&#39;t
tremble so, Karen&mdash;dear Karen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll try not to. I&#39;ll not be cowardly. It&mdash;it has
been a long&mdash;day.... I&#39;m thinking of Anna, too.
You know, if she had any papers, she was bringing
them to me. That will be against me."</p>

<p class="indent">"I forgot that," he said, appalled. Then he squared
his shoulders and forced a smile: "Anyway, whatever
faces you faces us <i>both</i>!... Dear&mdash;keep every atom
of courage you have. I shall stand by you, always.
But I must go now. Do you promise me to keep up
courage?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;dear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">They were excited, their every nerve now stretched
to the breaking, yet both were striving for self-control
in the instant menace of this new peril confronting them.
Neither knew just what they said or did; he bent over
her; she lifted her face to his, closing her eyes as his
lips touched her forehead. Then he went away swiftly,
and she sprang to the floor and locked the stateroom
door. The next moment the awful flare of a searchlight
turned the room to a pit of silvery fire, and she
cringed against the bed under the fierce white glory,
covering her bloodless face with both hands.</p>

<p class="indent">On deck, the Dutch captain, who was awaiting Guild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
at the companionway, came forward hastily and drew
him aside.</p>

<p class="indent">"They&#39;ve boarded us already," he said; "there comes
their lieutenant over the side. Tell me, Mr. Guild, are
your papers in order and your conscience clear? Can
I make a fight over this affair?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have no papers, but my conscience is in order.
Don&#39;t let them take us if you can help it."</p>

<p class="indent">"You have no papers?"</p>

<p class="indent">"None that can help me or my wife."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then it&#39;s no use fighting."</p>

<p class="indent">"Fight all the same!" whispered Guild, as they both
turned to meet the young naval officer who had just
stepped aboard. He and the Dutch captain exchanged
civilities stiffly, then Guild stepped forward into the lantern
light.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn Guild!" exclaimed the slim young officer in
surprise. "Is it <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Jamison!" ejaculated Guild, astonished. "Well this
is lucky! I&#39;m tremendously glad! I am indeed!"</p>

<p class="indent">They exchanged a warm impulsive hand-clasp, smiled
at each other&mdash;then the quick smile on the youthful
lieutenant&#39;s features altered, and his face fell.</p>

<p class="indent">"Guild," he said soberly, "I am afraid I shall have
to inconvenience you and&mdash;your wife. I&#39;m afraid I
shall have to ask you to come aboard the <i>Wyvern</i> with
me. I&#39;m sorry; I know it must inconvenience you fearfully&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Jamison! We <i>can&#39;t</i> go aboard your ship! What
on earth are you thinking of?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
"Orders," returned the young fellow gravely. "I&#39;ve
no discretion, you see."</p>

<p class="indent">As by common consent they had stepped aside from
the group of ships&#39; officers and, standing in the shadow
of a lifeboat, they now gazed at each other very seriously.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild said: "There must be some mistake about this.
I have no wife on board this boat."</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you not board this boat in company with your
wife?" asked Jamison in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"Our information is otherwise."</p>

<p class="indent">"Jamison, you know whether I am likely to lie to
you. And I say to you on my word of honour that I
did not come aboard this boat with my wife."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is she not on board?"</p>

<p class="indent">"She is not."</p>

<p class="indent">Jamison said regretfully: "No good, old fellow. We
know she is not your wife. But we want her. I think
you had better prepare her to come with us."</p>

<p class="indent">"Jamison, will you listen to me and believe me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, of course."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then, on my word of honour, the woman you have
come to take from this ship is absolutely innocent of
any&mdash;intentional&mdash;crime."</p>

<p class="indent">"I take your word for it, Guild."</p>

<p class="indent">"You can guess <i>my</i> sentiments in regard to this war,
can&#39;t you?" insisted Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think I can."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then listen, Jamison. I pledge you my word that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
through this young girl, and through me, nothing shall
ever happen that could in any manner be detrimental to
your country or its allies. Don&#39;t press this matter, for
God&#39;s sake!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Guild," he said quietly, "I believe you absolutely.
But&mdash;both you and this young lady must come aboard
the <i>Wyvern</i> with me. Those are my orders, old fellow.
I can&#39;t go back on them; I have no discretion in
this matter. You know that, don&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">After a silence, Guild linked his arm in the gold-laced
arm of his old-time friend and walked back to
where the captain stood fidgeting.</p>

<p class="indent">"I won&#39;t go, Jamison," he said, loudly but pleasantly.
"I am not obliged to go aboard your ship.
Captain Vandervelde, I claim the protection of your
flag for myself and for my wife."</p>

<p class="indent">"Captain Vandervelde knows that it means only
trouble for him," said Jamison, forcing a smile. "He
is not likely to defy the <i>Wyvern</i>, I think."</p>

<p class="indent">They all turned in the sudden glitter of the <i>Wyvern&#39;s</i>
searchlight and gazed across the darkness where the
unseen cruiser was playing on them from stem to stern.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you come with me, Guild?" asked Jamison
quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, Jamison, I&#39;m hanged if I do.... And that&#39;s
too close to the truth to be very funny," he added,
laughingly.</p>

<p class="indent">"The <i>Wyvern</i> will merely send a guard for you. It&#39;s
no good bluffing, Guild. You know it yourself."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
"International law is no bluff!"</p>

<p class="indent">"International law is merely in process of evolution
just now. It&#39;s in the making. And we are making it."</p>

<p class="indent">"That remark is very British."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I&#39;m afraid it is. I&#39;m sorry."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I won&#39;t go aboard the <i>Wyvern</i>, I tell you.
I&#39;ve <i>got</i> to stay on this ship! I&mdash;" he leaned over and
said under his breath&mdash;"it may mean death to me,
Jamison, to go aboard your ship. Not because of anything
I have to fear from <i>your</i> people. On the contrary.
But they&#39;ll shoot me in Germany. Can&#39;t you
tell your captain I&#39;m trustworthy?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What is the use, Guild?" said the young man gently.
"I have my orders."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild looked at him, looked about him at the grave
faces of the captain and the second officer, looked out
across the black void of water where the long beam of
the searchlight had shifted skyward, as though supplicating
Heaven once more.</p>

<p class="indent">Only a miracle could save Karen. He knew that as
he stood there, silent, with death in his heart.</p>

<p class="indent">And the miracle happened. For, as he stood staring
at the heavenward beam of the unseen cruiser&#39;s searchlight,
all at once the ship herself became grotesquely
visible, tilted up oddly out of the sea in the centre of
a dull reddish glow. The next instant a deadened boom
sounded across the night as though from infinite depths;
a shaft of fire two hundred feet high streamed skyward.</p>

<p class="indent">"That ship has been torpedoed! Oh, my God!" said
a voice.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
"The <i>Wyvern</i> has hit a mine!" roared the Dutch
captain. "I&#39;m going to get out of this <i>now</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent">Jamison&#39;s youthful face was marble; he swayed
slightly where he stood. The next instant he was over
the side like a cat, and Guild heard him hailing his
boat in an agonized voice which broke with a dry, boyish
sob.</p>

<p class="indent">From everywhere out of the blackness searchlights
stretched out tremulous phantom arms toward the
<i>Wyvern</i>, and their slender white beams crossed and recrossed
each other, focussing on the stricken warship,
which was already down by the stern, her after deck
awash, and that infernal red glow surrounding her like
the glow of hell around a soul in torment.</p>

<p class="indent">Passengers, seamen, stewards crowded and crushed
him to the rail, shouting, struggling, crying out in
terror or in pity.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild caught an officer by his gold sleeve. "We
ought to stand by her," he said mechanically. "Her
magazine is afire!"</p>

<p class="indent">"There are boats a-plenty to look after her," returned
the officer; "the British destroyers are all around
her like chicks about a dying hen. She&#39;s their parent
ship; and there go their boats, pulling hell for sweeps!
God! If it was a mine, I wish we were at Amsterdam,
I do!"</p>

<p class="indent">The steamer was already under way; electric signals
sparkled from her; signals were sparkling everywhere
in the darkness around them. And all the while the
cruiser with her mortal wound, enveloped in her red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
aura, agonized there in the horrible sombre radiance of
her own burning vitals.</p>

<p class="indent">Far away in the black void a ship began to fire star-shells.</p>

<p class="indent">As the awed throng on the moving liner&#39;s decks gazed
out across the night, the doomed cruiser split slowly
amidships, visibly, showing the vivid crack of her scarlet,
jagged wound. For a second or two she fairly
vomited hell-fire; lay there spouting it out in great
crimson gouts; then she crashed skyward into incandescent
fragments like a single gigantic bomb, and
thunderous blackness blotted out sea and sky once more.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>FORCE</h3>

<p class="indent">He knocked sharply at the stateroom door and
called, "Karen! It is I! Open!"</p>

<p class="indent">She flung open the door, satchel in hand,
and he entered, closed the door, relocked it, and dropped
down on the lounge, staring at space.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn! What is it?" she asked faintly, one hand
against her breast.</p>

<p class="indent">"It is all right," he said&mdash;"as far as we are concerned&mdash;for
the present, anyway. God! I can&#39;t realize
it&mdash;I can&#39;t get over it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"What, Kervyn?" she faltered, kneeling on the
lounge beside the half dazed man. "What happened?
Why are you so ghastly pale? Are we really quite
safe? Or are you trying to make it easier for me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No; you and I are safe enough for the moment," he
said. "But men are dying out yonder. The sea is full
of dead men, Karen. And&mdash;I saw it all."</p>

<p class="indent">"I heard guns. What has happened?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know. It was a mine perhaps, perhaps a
torpedo. A ship has been blown up." He lifted his
head and turned to her: "But you are not to say such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
a thing to anybody&mdash;after I leave you at Trois Fontaines."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, Kervyn."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not to anybody. Not even to your father. Do
you understand me, Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No. But I won&#39;t tell anybody."</p>

<p class="indent">"Because," he explained wearily, "the Admiralty
may have reasons for concealing it. If they mean to
conceal it, this ship of ours will be stopped again and
held for a while in some French or British port."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"So that the passengers cannot talk about what they
saw tonight."</p>

<p class="indent">His haunted glance fell on the satchel at their
feet. "As for that," he said, "I&#39;ve had enough of it,
and I&#39;ll take no further chances. Where are our passports?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Locked in with the other papers. I was all ready
to throw them out of the port when you knocked."</p>

<p class="indent">"Unlock the bag now. I&#39;ll get rid of the whole business,"
he said bluntly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn&mdash;I can&#39;t do that."</p>

<p class="indent">"What?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t destroy those papers if there is a chance of
getting through with them. I gave my promise, you
know."</p>

<p class="indent">The dull surprise in his eyes changed gradually to
impatience.</p>

<p class="indent">"If another ship stops us, they&#39;ll have to go overboard,
anyway."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
"We may not be stopped again. If we are, we have
time."</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;dear?"</p>

<p class="indent">A slight flush came into his haggard face; he hesitated,
looked up at her where she was kneeling on the
sofa beside him. "Dear," he said gently, "I have never
intended that you should carry those papers to your
father, or to anybody else."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t quite understand you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Try to understand. I am a friend to England&mdash;even
a closer friend to&mdash;Belgium."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know. But you are <i>my</i> friend, too."</p>

<p class="indent">"Devotedly, Karen." He took hold of her hand; she
slipped down to the sofa and settled there beside him
with a little air of confidence which touched and troubled
him.</p>

<p class="indent">"I <i>am</i> your friend," he said. "But there is another
friendship that demands first of all the settlement of
prior obligations. And, if these obligations conflict
with any others, the others must give way, Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you mean?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The obligations of friendship&mdash;of&mdash;of affection&mdash;these
must give way before a duty more imperative."</p>

<p class="indent">"What duty?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Allegiance."</p>

<p class="indent">"To&mdash;whom?"</p>

<p class="indent">"To the country in which my race had its origin."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes.... But America is neutral, Kervyn."</p>

<p class="indent">"I mean&mdash;Belgium," he said in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
"Belgium! Are you then Belgian?" she asked,
amazed.</p>

<p class="indent">"When Belgium is in trouble&mdash;yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"How can you be loyal to two countries?"</p>

<p class="indent">"By being loyal to my own manhood&mdash;and to the
God who made me," he answered in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"You feel so deeply about this war?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing on earth could stir me as deeply, Karen.
Unless&mdash;America were in danger."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;I can&#39;t understand."</p>

<p class="indent">"Let me help you. My family was Belgian. For
many years we have been good and loyal Americans.
America means home. But, nevertheless, we inherit
obligations toward the country of our origin which, so
far, time has not extinguished.... When I became
of military age I went to Belgium and served my time
in the Belgian army. Then I went&mdash;home. My father
did it before me. My grandfather before him. My
younger brother will do it, God willing. It is our custom
to fulfill our obligations," he added with a faint
smile, "even when those obligations seem to others a
trifle fanciful and old-fashioned."</p>

<p class="indent">She bent her fair head in silence, considering for a
space, her hand resting rather lifelessly in his. And,
after a few moments: "But how does all this interfere
with our friendship?" she asked innocently.</p>

<p class="indent">"It does not.... Only I could not let you take
those papers to Germany, Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">"But I&#39;ve promised."</p>

<p class="indent">"You promised to do it if it were possible." He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
lifted her hand to his lips. "But&mdash;it has become impossible,
Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">"Another ship may not interfere."</p>

<p class="indent">"No. But I must&mdash;interfere."</p>

<p class="indent">"You! <i>Kervyn!</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">"Dear&mdash;I <i>must</i>."</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Betray</i> me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen! Karen! What are you saying?"</p>

<p class="indent">"If you take my papers away you betray our friendship!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have told you that there is a higher obligation
than friendship. Even <i>your</i> friendship, Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&mdash;you mean to take my papers from me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, dear."</p>

<p class="indent">"By&mdash;by <i>violence</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen! Look at me!"</p>

<p class="indent">She gave him a white, breathless glance, wrenched
her hand from his, stooped suddenly, seized the satchel,
and, gathering it against her breast, clasped both arms
around it. Then she looked him straight in the eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," he said, "that is the only way. You must
keep your word to the last and do your best. Only&mdash;remember
that what I do now has no bearing whatever
upon our friendship. I&mdash;I care for you&mdash;at this
moment&mdash;more than I ever did. So&mdash;forgive me&mdash;Karen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I never shall! Kervyn! Kervyn&mdash;think what you
are doing!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He encircled her with his left arm, and with his right
hand he gathered both of her slender wrists in his grasp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
and held them. The satchel rolled from her knees to
the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn!" she cried, "think what you are doing!"
She looked up into his set face where he held her crushed
against his shoulder. "I am your friend. Think what
you are doing! I&mdash;I care&mdash;so much&mdash;for you!"</p>

<p class="indent">"And I for you, Karen.... Is that the key around
your neck on that blue ribbon?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You shall not have it. Oh, Kervyn! Kervyn!" she
gasped&mdash;"what are you doing to our friendship! What
are you doing!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 442px;">
<a name="gs05" id="gs05"></a><img class="border" src="images/gs05.jpg" width="442" height="700" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">"&#39;Kervyn! Kervyn&mdash;Think what you are doing!&mdash;&#39;"</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The struggle was already over; with his left arm he
held both of her arms pinned tightly to the supple body
which lay panting against him, while with his other
hand he untied the narrow blue bow-knot at her throat
and freed the tiny key. Then he released her. They
both were deadly pale. She dropped back among the
pillows and lay there staring at him. There was in the
white calm of her face an expression almost pleasant.</p>

<p class="indent">"So&mdash;you have done it," she said in a curiously
altered voice, but her lips scarcely moved when she
spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not answer, but in her level eyes he saw blue
lightning glimmer.</p>

<p class="indent">"You did your best," he said. "Your conscience is
clear. Nobody can reproach you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you understand," she said in a low, expressionless
voice, "that I am your enemy?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you reason that way, Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Reason?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
"Yes. Reason it out, Karen, before you come to
such a conclusion."</p>

<p class="indent">She said, very quietly: "A woman takes a shorter cut
to her conclusions than by reasoning. As I did with
you ... when I gave you my friendship ... unasked&mdash;"
She turned her head swiftly, and sat for a
moment while the starting tears dried in her eyes, unshed.
They dried slowly while the battle raged within
her&mdash;combat of mind and heart with every outraged
instinct in arms, every emotion, every impulse. Pride,
belief, faith, tenderness&mdash;all desperately wounded,
fought blindly in the assault upon her heart, seeming to
tear it to a thousand bleeding fragments.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps, like the fair body of Osiris, it was immortal&mdash;a
deathless, imperishable thing&mdash;or that what had
come into it had become indestructible. For, after her
heart lay in burning fragments within her, she turned
and looked at him, and in her eyes was all the tragedy
of her sex&mdash;and all its never-ending mystery to men.</p>

<p class="indent">"I must end what I have begun," he said gently.</p>

<p class="indent">"Does it matter, now?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know, Karen. I have no choice&mdash;even when
your hatred threatens me.... I suppose it will be
that, when I unlock your satchel."</p>

<p class="indent">He picked it up and fitted the key to the lock. As
he opened it, a faint fresh fragrance came from it, as
though he was violating the delicate intimacy of this
young girl herself.</p>

<p class="indent">But he set his jaws; she saw the cheek muscles
tighten; and he drew from the satchel two flat envelopes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
One contained the forged passports, and he placed
these in his breast pocket, then looked steadily at her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Our friendship breaks with those seals," she said
unsteadily.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen&mdash;I cannot help it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, you can help it.... Kervyn!... Wait! I
will&mdash;will say&mdash;that it is more than friendship that
breaks&mdash;" She caught her breath and her lip quivered&mdash;"I&mdash;I
have the courage to say it&mdash;if it means anything
to you&mdash;if it will help&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">His face reddened, then it grew pallid and expressionless.</p>

<p class="indent">"Even that," he said, "must stand aside....
Karen, from the moment I saw you I have been&mdash;in
love with you."</p>

<p class="indent">And, looking her steadily in the eyes, he broke the
seals.</p>

<p class="indent">When the last seal broke she gave a little cry, turned
and covered her eyes with both hands.</p>

<p class="indent">As for Guild, he stood with a sheet of paper in his
hands, staring at the tracery which covered it and
which meant absolutely nothing to him. Then he looked
at the remaining sheets of paper. None had any significance
to him. There were three sheets of thin
translucent paper. These sheets were numbered from one
to three.</p>

<p class="indent">The first seemed to be a hasty study from some
artist&#39;s sketch book. It appeared to be a roughly executed
and hasty sketch of several rather oddly shaped
trees&mdash;a mere note jotted down to record the impression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
of the moment&mdash;trees, a foreland, a flight of little
hedge birds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 609px;">
<img src="images/line01.png" width="609" height="700" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">On it, in English, the artist had written "Sunset."
Indeed, the declining and somewhat archaic sun on the
horizon and the obviously evening flight of the birds
seemed to render the label unnecessary.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
For a long while Guild stood studying it in the
light of the stateroom ceiling lamp. And what continually
arrested his attention and perplexed him was
the unusual shapes of the trees and the un-birdlike flight
of the birds. Also artists don&#39;t sketch on such paper.</p>

<p class="indent">Now and then he looked across at Karen with an inscrutable
expression, and each time he looked at her
his face seemed to grow more rigid and his set jaws
more inflexible.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl crouched in the corner of the lounge, her
face covered by both hands and pressed against the
pillows.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not speak to her. Presently he turned to the
next paper. It bore the rough sketch of a fish, and
was numbered 2.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/line02.png" width="600" height="318" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">It was a wretched drawing, intended, evidently, to
resemble an old pike and three young ones. What it
meant he had no idea. He passed to the third and last
sheet of paper, and it instantly held his attention.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
On it was depicted a figure, which he supposed was
the artist&#39;s idea of a Japanese dancing girl. She held
a fan in her left hand. Over her extended right hand
a butterfly hovered.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 625px;">
<img src="images/line03.png" width="625" height="700" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">But what interested and concentrated Guild&#39;s attention
was not the very amateurish drawing, but the series
of silly decorations on the paper above her head&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
number of quartered circles inclosed in squares and
oblongs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 472px;">
<img src="images/line04.png" width="472" height="700" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">As decorations they meant nothing, indicated nothing,
except that the intellect responsible for them must
be a meagre one.</p>

<p class="indent">But as a cipher message these doubly bisected circles
promised anything.</p>

<p class="indent">This is what Guild saw and what caused him to seat
himself on the sofa beside the girl who still lay huddled
over her pillows, her face hidden in her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">Seated, he drew out the portfolio containing his letters
and a notebook. Then, slipping a lead-pencil from
the leather socket and tearing out a sheet of paper,
he started work&mdash;using the leather-backed book for a
support&mdash;on a cipher which looked to be impossible.
Yet, all ciphers are solved by the same method. And he
knew it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/line05.png" width="600" height="319" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">The first thing he did was to find his "numbers" in
the mass of quartered circles. And, working steadily,
swiftly, but intelligently, he had, in the course of an
hour, discovered, separated and jotted down, nine of the
quartered disks which he believed to represent numbers;
and one extra disk which he supposed to be zero. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
he numbered each symbol accordingly: merely eliminating
all lines except those bisecting the smaller circles.
This gave him in order</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/line06.png" width="600" height="105" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">The next thing to do was to find what letters those
numbers, or combinations of numbers, represented.</p>

<p class="indent">For a while he tried English, but arrived at no
convincing result. So he tried German, first making a
list of the letters which were likely to occur most frequently
in the written language and then trying them
with the symbols which occurred most frequently in the
manuscript before him.</p>

<p class="indent">He found that the first symbol represented the figures
21.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/line07.png" width="600" height="327" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">The twenty-first letter of the alphabet is <i>u</i>. He wrote it.</p>

<p class="indent">The next symbol was</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 578px;">
<img src="images/line08.png" width="578" height="308" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">for which he substituted the figures 14. The fourteenth
letter of the alphabet is <i>n</i>. He had, so far, two letters,
<i>u</i> and <i>n</i>, to experiment with.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
He had sat for several minutes gazing absently
at these two letters when, like a shot, it struck him that
the French word for the number, one, was spelled <i>un</i>.
Could the key of the cipher be French? He separated
and jotted down the next combination of disks</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 536px;">
<img src="images/line09.png" width="536" height="295" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">which gave him the numbers 19. The nineteenth letter
of the alphabet is <i>s</i>. He wrote it.</p>

<p class="indent">The next symbol was</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 334px;">
<img src="images/line10.png" width="334" height="289" alt="" title="" />

<p class="indent">or the figure 9. The ninth letter of the alphabet is <i>i</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">which, translated, gave him 24. The twenty-fourth letter
of the alphabet is <i>x</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">He now had the letters <i>s-i-x</i>. And no sooner had he
written them in order than the word six stared him in
the face and he flushed with pure excitement.</p>

<p class="indent">He had now two words, <i>un</i> and <i>six</i>. The chances
were that he was somewhere on the right track and he
fell to work with a concentration and ardour which left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
him oblivious to everything else&mdash;to time and place, and
to the silent, motionless little figure huddled over the
pillows beside him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/line12.png" width="600" height="496" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">A Fragment from Guild&#39;s Notebook</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">At the end of an hour&mdash;checked twice&mdash;but finally
overcoming apparent defeat, and always following the
same method of deduction, he came to an end of his
symbols, and he found the leaf from his notebook was
covered with the following words in order of symbol:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Un, six douze cinq cinq vingt, douze quinz&#39;
vingt-un sept eight, nineteen vingt trois nine douze
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
douze twenty-five, eight cinq trois eight vingt, six
quinze douze douze quinze vingt-trois, deux nine
eighteen quatre nineteen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">For these numerals spelled out capriciously in either
abbreviated French or English he substituted numbers
in the sequence given:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"1&mdash;6&mdash;12&mdash;5&mdash;5&mdash;20&mdash;12&mdash;15&mdash;21&mdash;7&mdash;8&mdash;19</span><br />
<span class="i0">&mdash;23&mdash;9&mdash;12&mdash;12&mdash;25&mdash;8&mdash;5&mdash;3&mdash;8&mdash;20&mdash;6&mdash;15</span><br />
<span class="i0">&mdash;12&mdash;12&mdash;15&mdash;23&mdash;2&mdash;9&mdash;18&mdash;4&mdash;19."</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Then for the figure 1 he wrote the first letter of the
alphabet&mdash;<i>A</i>. For the number six he wrote the sixth
letter of the alphabet <i>F</i>. For the number 12, the twelfth
letter of the alphabet <i>L</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">And when he had written letters for every figure in
order given he had on his sheet of paper</p>

<p class="center">A FLEETLOUGHSWILLYHECHTFOLLOW<br />
BIRDS</p>

<p class="indent">After a while he separated the words <i>A</i>, <i>Fleet</i>, <i>Follow</i>,
and <i>Birds</i>, leaving the unintelligible sequence of letters
LOUGHSWILLYHECHT.</p>

<p class="indent">Out of this, for a long while, he could make nothing,
until, by chance, taking the last five letters together,
it suddenly occurred to him that the German word for
pike was HECHT. Then, in a flash, he remembered
the badly drawn picture of a pike and its young. Pike
or Hecht, that was one of the words in all probability.
But what <i>other</i> word the word Hecht represented he
could not imagine.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
He looked at his notebook again. The letters remaining
were LOUGHSWILLY. They meant absolutely
nothing in any language he had even heard of. He
studied what he already had&mdash;A Fleet (Blank) Pike
Follow Birds. A <i>pike</i> follow <i>Birds</i>&mdash;<i>birds</i>&mdash;and swift
as lightning a thought struck him which set him tingling
to his finger-tips: somewhere in that rough, hasty,
and apparently innocent sketch in which oddly shaped
trees and a line of little birds figured, lay the key to the
whole thing.</p>

<p class="indent">He felt it, he <i>knew</i> it. He spread out the drawing
on his knees and studied it with terrible concentration,
conscious somehow or other that something about it,
something <i>in</i> it, was vaguely familiar to him. <i>What?</i>
Had he ever before seen another sketch by the same
hand? He could not recollect. It was like millions of
rough, hasty sketches jotted down by painters as notes
for their own guidance only and not for others to see.</p>

<p class="indent">What was there about it unusual? The trees? The
<i>shapes</i> of the trees. Ah! he was getting nearer the
goal&mdash;he realized it, felt it, and, balked, fell into a
mental rage for a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">Then his habitual self-command returned; he squared
his jaws, gazed grimly at the trees, and forced himself
once more to answer his own questions.</p>

<p class="indent">The shapes of the trees, then, were unusual. He had
gotten that far. What was unusual in their shapes?
The trunks and branches? No. The foliage. No.
The outline!</p>

<p class="indent">"God!" he whispered. And he had it.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
Over the sofa was hanging a map of the British Isles
and of the Western coast of Europe. Dotted lines indicated
the course taken by the Holland Line steamers.
He reached up, unhooked it, looked at it, then at the
drawing in his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he detached half of the thin sheet of paper on
which the sketch was drawn and laid it over the sketch.
Being translucent to the verge of transparency, he could
see the drawing beneath the thin sheet covering it.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, with his pencil, he steadily traced the <i>outlines</i>
of the trees.</p>

<p class="indent">When he had done this and had removed the sketch
from beneath his tracing-paper he had what he expected&mdash;an
<i>outline</i> of the British Isles, the Hebrides,
Orkneys, Shetlands; part of the coast of Norway, the
French, Belgian and Dutch coast. Heligoland, and the
German coast at Cuxhaven and Wilhelmshaven.</p>

<p class="indent">From the map of the steamship company he carefully
filled in boundaries and a few principal towns, then
placing his outline drawing over the sketch of the trees
he drew a dotted line following exactly the flight of the
little birds.</p>

<p class="indent">Where that flight terminated he made an arrow, then
turned his eyes on the steamer map to find out where that
arrow&#39;s point rested.</p>

<p class="indent">And there on the Irish coast he saw the name Lough
Swilly!</p>

<p class="indent">It was the last link!&mdash;the last but one.</p>

<p class="indent">"A Fleet Lough Swilly. Hecht (Pike) follow birds."</p>

<p class="indent">A pike, with little pike following her, was to follow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
the flight of the birds&mdash;the dotted line on his outline
map. The dotted line curved up out of Cuxhaven,
around the Orkneys and Hebrides and into Lough
Swilly&mdash;<i>where there was a fleet</i>!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/map01.png" width="600" height="566" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">Out of Cuxhaven&mdash;<i>Cuxhaven!</i> where lay the German
submarines!&mdash;A pike, and young! A parent ship and
submarines!</p>

<p class="indent">The last link was forged; the chain complete&mdash;not
quite&mdash;not entirely. The Japanese dancing girl? And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
under the number of the sketch, 3,&mdash;were three symbols.
They were junks with latten sails.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps there were three Japanese battleships at
Lough Swilly. It didn&#39;t matter; the chain was complete
enough for him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>STRATEGY</h3>

<p class="indent">As he rose from the sofa, stretching his arms to
ease his cramped muscles, Guild became conscious
that he was very tired.</p>

<p class="indent">He had had little sleep the night before and none at
all this night. He glanced at his watch; it was four
o&#39;clock in the morning. He went to the port, unscrewed
it, and looked out into pitch darkness. There
was not a light to be seen on the sea, no flare from any
headland, no spark which might indicate a lighthouse,
not a star overhead, not a sparkle save for the splintered
reflection of the vessel&#39;s own lights running over
the water alongside, through which foaming, curling
waves raced and fled away into the black obscurity
astern.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned and looked gravely at Karen. The girl
still lay unstirring among the pillows on the sofa. One
arm covered her head as though to shield it from some
blow.</p>

<p class="indent">He bent beside her, listening to her breathing. It
was quiet and regular, and on her cheek was a flush
like the delicate colour of a sleeping child.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
He had no mind to disturb her, yet he could not make
her more comfortable without awaking her.</p>

<p class="indent">All he dared do was to unbutton her spats very cautiously,
and slip off the little brown suede shoes.</p>

<p class="indent">Over her he laid the blankets from the bed, lightly,
then opened wide the port.</p>

<p class="indent">His own toilet for the night was even simpler; he
folded together the batch of damning papers, originals,
his own notes, the forged passports, strapped them with
an elastic band, buttoned them inside his breast pocket,
reached over and extinguished the electric globe, and,
fully dressed, lay down on the stripped bed in darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">They had been traveling sixteen hours. Allowing for
their detention by the ill-omened <i>Wyvern</i>, they should
dock at Amsterdam in five or six hours more.</p>

<p class="indent">He tried to sleep; but his nerves were very much alive
and his excited brain refused to subscribe to the body&#39;s
fatigue.</p>

<p class="indent">All that had happened since he first saw Karen Girard
he now went over and over in his mind in spite of himself.
He strove to stop thinking, and could not; and
sometimes the lurid horror of the <i>Wyvern</i> possessed
him with all its appalling details made plain to his imagination&mdash;details
not visible from the liner&#39;s decks, yet
perhaps the more ghastly because hidden by distance
and by the infernal glare that fringed the doomed
ship like a very nimbus from hell itself.</p>

<p class="indent">This obsessed him, and the villainous information
which he had wrested from the papers which this young
girl had been carrying&mdash;information amply sufficient to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
convict her and to make inevitable the military execution
of the man Grätz and the grinning chauffeur,
Bush.</p>

<p class="indent">And if the wretched maid, Anna, had been arrested
with papers similar to these on her person, her case, too,
was hopeless. Because the very existence of England
depended upon extinguishing forever people who dealt
in secret information like that which lay folded and
buttoned under his belted coat of tweed.</p>

<p class="indent">He knew it, knew what his fate must have been had
the satchel been searched on Fresh Wharf&mdash;knew what
Karen&#39;s fate must have been, also, surely, surely!</p>

<p class="indent">And had those papers been taken aboard the <i>Wyvern</i>
it had not been very long before the simplicity
of the cipher had been discovered by anybody trained
in code work.</p>

<p class="indent">For, in spite of its surface complexity, the cipher
was a singularly simple one, even a stupid code, based
on simple principles long known and understood in all
of their hundreds of variations.</p>

<p class="indent">And all such ciphers, granted time and patience,
could be solved by the same basic principles. The only
function of that kind of code was to so multiply its intricacies
and variations that, with a time limit for delivery
understood, measures could be taken at the other
end to minimize the effect of discovery, the elapsing of
the time limit serving as an automatic warning that
message or messenger were under forcible detention
within the enemy&#39;s lines.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, it had been a stupid cipher, and an easy one.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
A trained man would have solved it in half the time
he had required.</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing about the message remained really obscure
except the Japanese dancing girl playing with her butterfly
and fan, and the lack of information concerning
the "fleet" at anchor or cruising near "Lough Swilly"
on the Irish coast.</p>

<p class="indent">As far as the fleet was concerned, Guild was very confident
that he understood. The whereabouts of the British
battleship fleet was not known, had been carefully
guarded. Without a doubt Lough Swilly was its rendezvous;
and the German spy system in England had
discovered it and was sending the information to Berlin
with a suggestion that submarines "follow the birds,"
i. e., take that dotted course around the northern Scottish
coast, slip south into Lough Swilly, and attack
the first line of battle squadron where it had been supposed
to lurk in safety, awaiting its call to action. That
was as clear as daylight, but the Japanese figure he
could not understand.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">He was utterly unable to sleep. After an hour&#39;s
staring into the darkness he rose cautiously, opened
the stateroom door and stepped into the lighted corridor.</p>

<p class="indent">Here he lighted a cigarette against regulations and
began to pace up and down.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently the sharp nose of a steward detected the
aroma of tobacco, and he came prowling into the corridor.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
So Guild nodded and tossed the cigarette out of the
open port at the end of the corridor.</p>

<p class="indent">"We ought to dock by nine," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"About nine, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"We&#39;re lucky to have run afoul of nothing resembling
a mine."</p>

<p class="indent">"God, sir! Wasn&#39;t it awful about the <i>Wyvern</i>! I
expect some passenger steamer will get it yet. Mines
by the hundreds are coming ashore on the coast of Holland."</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you had any news by wireless?" asked Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"A little, sir. They&#39;ve been fighting all night south
of Ostend. Also, we had a wire from London that a
German light cruiser, the <i>Schmetterling</i>, is at Valparaiso,
and that a Japanese cruiser, the <i>Geisha</i>, and a
French one, the <i>Eventail</i>, have been ordered after her."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild nodded carelessly, stretched his arms, yawned,
and returned to the stateroom, knowing that now, at
last, he was in possession of every item in the secret
document.</p>

<p class="indent">For the Japanese dancing girl was the <i>Geisha</i>, the
fan in her hand was the French cruiser <i>Eventail</i> and
the butterfly fluttering about her was the German light
cruiser <i>Schmetterling</i>&mdash;which in that agreeable language
means "butterfly," and which no doubt had made an
attempt upon the <i>Geisha</i> and had been repulsed.</p>

<p class="indent">And this warning was sent that the <i>Schmetterling</i>
had better keep her distance, because the <i>Eventail</i> had
now joined the Japanese ship, and the two meant mischief.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
As for the drawing of the Pike, perhaps on the
German naval list there might have been a vessel named
the <i>Hecht</i>. He did not know. The symbol of the most
ferocious fresh-water fish in Europe was sufficient to
indicate the nature of the craft even had the flight of the
"birds" not made it unmistakable. There could be no
doubt about it that the Hecht with the three little
Hechts following had been explicitly invited to cruise
in the North Sea and have a look-in at Lough Swilly.
And that was quite enough to understand.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">He turned on the cabin light, went to Karen&#39;s side
and looked at her.</p>

<p class="indent">She had moved, but only in her sleep apparently.
The back of one hand lay across her forehead; her face
was turned upward, and on the flushed cheeks there
were traces of tears.</p>

<p class="indent">But she still slept. He arranged her coverings again,
stood gazing at her for a moment more, then he extinguished
the light and once more lay down on the bare
mattress, using his arm for a pillow.</p>

<p class="indent">But sleep eluded him for all his desperate weariness.
He thought of Grätz and of Bush and of the wretched
woman involved by them and now a prisoner.</p>

<p class="indent">The moment he turned over these papers to the British
Consul in Amsterdam the death warrant of Grätz
and Bush was signed. He knew that. He knew also
that the papers in his possession were going to be delivered
to British authority. But first he meant to give
Grätz and Bush a sporting chance to clear out.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
Not because they had aided him. They cared nothing
about him. It was Karen they had aided, and their
help was given to her because of von Reiter.</p>

<p class="indent">No, it was not in him to do the thing that way.
Had he been a British officer on duty it had been hard
enough to do such a thing.</p>

<p class="indent">As it was he must give them their chance and he knew
of only one way to do it. This point settled he dismissed
it from his mind and, with a slight sigh, permitted
his harassed thoughts to lead him where they seemed
always now inclined to lead him when permitted&mdash;back
to the young girl he had known only a few hours, but
in whose company it seemed to him that he had already
lived a century.</p>

<p class="indent">He was not a man given to easy friendships, not a
man in whom sensations were easily stirred. Under
ordinary circumstances, perhaps, neither the youthful
beauty of this girl, nor her talents and accomplishments
had stirred him to more than an amiably impersonal
interest. He had known many women and had been
friends with a few. But on his part the friendships had
not been sentimental.</p>

<p class="indent">Women of all sorts and conditions he had known:
fashionable idlers, professional women, domesticated
women; women with ideas, women without them, busy
women with leisure for mischief, mischievous women
whose business was leisure, happy women, unhappy
ones, calm ones, restless ones, clever ones, stupid ones
and their even more irritating sisters who promised to
amount to something and never did, all these varieties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
of the species he had known, but never a woman like this.</p>

<p class="indent">Usually he could place a woman after seeing her move
and hearing her speak. He could only place Karen on
a social par with any woman he had ever known, and
he was afraid she didn&#39;t belong there, because well-born
German Mädchens don&#39;t interne themselves in nun-like
seclusion far from Vaterland, Vater, and maternal
apron-strings, with intervals of sallying forth into the
world for a few months&#39; diversion as a professional actress
on the stage.</p>

<p class="indent">At least Guild had never heard of any girls who did
such things. But there remained the chance, of course,
that Karen Girard was a perfectly new type to him.</p>

<p class="indent">One fact was evident; her father was a Prussian officer
and belonged to the Prussian aristocracy. But
gentlemen of these castes do not permit their daughters
the freedom that Karen enjoyed.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a mystery about the matter, probably not
an agreeable one. Antecedents, conditions and facts
did not agree. There was no logic in her situation.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild realized this. And at the same time he realized
that he had never liked any woman as much&mdash;had never
come to care for any woman as easily, as naturally,
and as quickly as he had come to care for Karen Girard.</p>

<p class="indent">It stirred him now to remember that this young girl
had responded, frankly, fearlessly, naturally; had even
met him more than half-way with a sweet sincerity and
confidence that touched him again as he thought of it.</p>

<p class="indent">Truly he had never looked into such honest eyes, or
into lovelier ones,&mdash;two clear, violet wells of light. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
Truth, who abides in wells, could not have chosen for
her dwelling place habitations more suitable.</p>

<p class="indent">She seemed to possess all qualities as well as all accomplishments
and graces of mind and body. The quality
of courage was hers&mdash;a courage adorable in its
femininity. But there was nothing hard about it, only
firmness&mdash;like the white firmness of her skin. And her
intuitive generosity was as quick and melting as the
exquisite motives which prompted it.</p>

<p class="indent">Never could he forget that in the dreadful peril of
the moment, she had tried to give him a chance to escape
the consequences of his companionship with her,&mdash;had
tried to send him ashore at the last moment so that
she alone might remain to face whatever there was confronting
her.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a brave thing to do, generous, self-forgetful,
merciful, and finely just. For though she had not tried
to deceive him she had gradually realized that she herself
might be deceived, and that she was in honour bound
to warn him concerning her suspicions of the satchel&#39;s
contents.</p>

<p class="indent">And now&mdash;in the end&mdash;and after danger was practically
over, how did they stand, he and she? How had
they emerged from the snarl of circumstances?</p>

<p class="indent">Had his gentle violence killed forever a very wonderful
beginning of what they both had spoken of as
friendship? And she&mdash;he reddened in the darkness as he
remembered&mdash;she had begged him in the name of
friendship not to violate it&mdash;had spoken of it, in the excitement
of emotion, as <i>more</i> than friendship.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
It had been the most difficult thing he ever had had
to do.</p>

<p class="indent">Was it true that her friendship had turned to hatred?</p>

<p class="indent">He wondered, wondered at the dull unhappiness which
the thought brought with it. And, wondering, fell
asleep.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">In the grey of dawn Karen sat up, wide-eyed, still
tremulous from the dream of death that had awakened
her.</p>

<p class="indent">Through the open port a grey sky glimmered. She
rose to her knees and gazed out upon a grey waste of
water heaving to the horizon.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she turned and looked across at the bed where
Guild lay, his blond head cradled on one arm, asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes rested on him a long while. Then she
caught sight of her shoes and spats on the floor&mdash;looked
down at the blankets and covers that had kept
her warm. The next moment her eyes fell on her satchel
where it stood open, the key still in the lock, and her
silver toilet articles glimmering dully inside.</p>

<p class="indent">The vague tenderness in her blue eyes vanished; <i>he</i>
had done <i>this</i>, too!&mdash;shamefully, by force, treading
mercilessly on the frail bud of friendship&mdash;ignoring
everything, sacrificing everything to a dull, obstinate
determination which he had characterized as duty.</p>

<p class="indent">She turned and looked at the man who had done all
this, her eyes darkly beautiful, her lips stern.</p>

<p class="indent">Duty? He had not considered the duty she owed.
He had not respected her promise to bring back what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
had been intrusted to her. And when the discussion had
tired him&mdash;when her warnings, pleadings&mdash;even her
appeals in the name of the first friendship she had ever
given&mdash;had been ignored, he had coolly used violence.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, violence, although, perhaps, the violence had not
been very violent. But it was force&mdash;and hateful to her
who never before had been obliged to endure the arrogance
which her caste only knew how to dispense.</p>

<p class="indent">"So brauch&#39; Ich Gewalt!" kept ringing in her ears
like a very obsession as she knelt there, sitting back on
her own supple limbs, and watching the sleeping man
out of beautiful hostile eyes.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>That</i> man! That <i>American</i>&mdash;or Belgian&mdash;whatever
he was&mdash;with his clear grey eyes and his short yellow
hair and that mouth of his which could be faintly
humorous at times and, at times be so ugly and set&mdash;what
was there about him that she liked&mdash;or rather
<i>had</i> liked?</p>

<p class="indent">Not his features; they were only passable from an
ornamental point of view&mdash;not his lean but powerful
figure, which resembled many other figures she had
seen in England&mdash;not his manner particularly&mdash;at least
she had seen more deferential attitudes, more polish of
the courtly and continental sort, more empressement.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>What</i> was it she liked,&mdash;had <i>once</i> liked in this man?
Nothing! <i>Nothing!</i>&mdash;the tears suddenly glimmered in
her eyes and she winked them dry, angrily.</p>

<p class="indent">And to think&mdash;to remember in years to come that
she&mdash;<i>she</i> had pleaded with that man in the name of
friendship&mdash;and of something <i>more</i> than friendship!&mdash;The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
hot colour mantled face and throat and she covered
her eyes in a sudden agony of mortification.</p>

<p class="indent">For a few moments she remained so, then her hands
fell, helplessly again.</p>

<p class="indent">And, as she knelt there looking at him through the
increasing daylight, suddenly her eyes narrowed, and
her set face grew still and intent.</p>

<p class="indent">Crowding out of the shallow breast pocket of his Norfolk
where he lay were papers. <i>Her</i> papers!</p>

<p class="indent">The next instant, lithely, softly, soundlessly on her
unshod feet, she had slipped from the lounge and crossed
the stateroom to his side, and her fingers already
touched the edges of the packet.</p>

<p class="indent">Her papers! And her hand rested on them. But she
did not take them. There was something about the
stealth of the act that checked her,&mdash;something that
seemed foreign, repugnant to her nature.</p>

<p class="indent">Breathless, her narrow hand poised, she hesitated,
trying to remember that the papers were hers&mdash;striving
to aid herself with the hot and shameful memory of the
violence he had offered her.</p>

<p class="indent">Why couldn&#39;t she take them? This man and she were
now at war! War has two phases, violence and strategy.
Both are legitimate; he had played his part, and
this part was strategy. Why shouldn&#39;t she play that
part? Why?</p>

<p class="indent">But her hand wavered, fell away, and she looked down
into his sleeping face and knew that she could not do it.</p>

<p class="indent">After a moment his eyes opened and met hers, pleasantly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
She blushed to her hair.</p>

<p class="indent">He said: "Why didn&#39;t you take them, Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You couldn&#39;t understand if I told you," she said
with youthful bitterness.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked very grave at that. She turned, picked
up shoes and spats, and seated herself on the sofa.</p>

<p class="indent">So he got up, opened the door and went up on deck,
leaving her the stateroom to herself.</p>

<p class="indent">At the office of the wireless station the operator
seemed to have no objection to sending a message for
him to the British Consul in Amsterdam, and obligingly
looked up the address. So Guild sent his message and
prepaid reply.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he went into the smoking-room and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p class="indent">He was dozing when a steward awoke him with a reply
to his wireless message:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="margin-left4">Kervyn Guild<br />
On board S. S. <i>Feyenoord</i><br />
Will call at American Consulate. Many thanks.</p>

<p class="margin-left8"><span class="smcap">Churchill</span>, Consul.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">He sat thinking for a few minutes. Then remembering
that he did not know where the American Consul
was to be found, he went again to the wireless office and
procured the address.</p>

<p class="indent">Turning, as he was leaving, to thank the boyish
operator, he found that youth&#39;s shrewd eyes fixed on
him intently.</p>

<p class="indent">"Look out, sir," said the operator, in perfectly good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
English. "There&#39;s a lot o&#39; talk about you on board."</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you mean?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Wasn&#39;t it you the <i>Wyvern</i> was wanting?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re friendly to us, I take it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you mean to England?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I am."</p>

<p class="indent">"I fancied so. Be very careful aboard this boat, sir.
Half the crew and most of the stewards are German."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks," said Guild smilingly.</p>

<p class="indent">But as he walked slowly away he realized rather uneasily
what an object of interest he had become to the
personnel of the ship since the <i>Wyvern</i> had honoured
him by her wireless inquiries concerning him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>IN THE RAIN</h3>

<p class="indent">He went straight to the writing-room. Only one
or two of his fellow-passengers were up, and he
had the place to himself.</p>

<p class="indent">He wrote first:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">W. A. Churchill, Esquire,</span><br />
<span class="i0">British Consulate,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Plantage Middenlaan 20,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Amsterdam,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Holland</span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">The following items of information should be
immediately transmitted to your home Government.
The importance of the matters in question
admit of no delay.</p>

<p class="indent">1st. It has come to my knowledge that German
spies in England have discovered the whereabouts
of a British fleet&mdash;presumably the first line
battle fleet&mdash;and have attempted to communicate
the intelligence to Berlin. One document in
cipher embodying this intelligence has been intercepted
and translated. But other communications
in cipher may get through.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span></p>

<p class="indent">2d. Another document of the same sort advises
the Berlin Government to send from Cuxhaven a
cruiser (parent ship) as convoy to three submarines
for the purpose of attacking the British armoured
ships.</p>

<p class="indent">The rendezvous of the British ships, as given
in the cipher message, is Lough Swilly, North
Irish coast.</p>

<p class="indent">The route suggested for the German cruiser and
submarines is around the north coast of Scotland.</p>

<p class="indent">3d. Still a third document in cipher informs
the German Government that the light cruiser,
<i>Schmetterling</i>, at or off Valparaiso, is being pursued
by the Japanese ship <i>Geisha</i> and the French
gunboat <i>Eventail</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">4th. The fourth and last item of information
to be transmitted to your Government concerns an
actuality witnessed by myself and by the majority
of the passengers of this steamer, now docking
at Rotterdam.</p>

<p class="indent">Last night, somewhere between eleven o&#39;clock
and midnight, and somewhere off the Belgian
coast, H. M. S. <i>Wyvern</i> was blown up, whether
by mine or torpedo or by a bomb from some unseen
air-craft I do not know. She was using her
searchlight on the clouds at the time.</p>

<p class="indent">The ship was tilted out of the water at an odd
angle when the red glare that suddenly enveloped
her made her visible. It appears to me as though
some submarine convulsion had heaved her up out
of the sea.</p>

<p class="indent">There was one of her officers aboard our liner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
when the catastrophe occurred&mdash;Lieutenant Jamison.
A boat&#39;s crew lay alongside of us. With
these exceptions it does not seem probable that
anybody aboard the <i>Wyvern</i> could have escaped
death, although other ships were in the vicinity
and their searchlights played upon her, and I saw
small boats on the way to her before she finally
blew to pieces.</p>

<p class="indent">This is the information which both duty and
inclination impel me to place at the disposal of
the British Government.</p>

<p class="indent">Permit me to add that I am leaving in the hands
of the United States consul, Henry H. Morgan,
Esquire, a separate packet of papers containing
full corroboration of the foregoing details.</p>

<p class="indent">The packet is addressed to you in his care, but
he will be instructed to give you this letter, only,
and not to deliver the packet to you until a week
from today for reasons which I cannot explain.</p>

<p class="indent">The packet contains&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">1st. Three pages of cipher and pictographs employed
by the German spy system in London.</p>

<p class="indent">2d. A key to the cipher.</p>

<p class="indent">3d. A key to the pictographs.</p>

<p class="indent">4th. A full translation of the cipher.</p>

<p class="indent">5th. A translation of the pictographs.</p>

<p class="indent">6th. A map.</p>

<p class="indent">The German personage to whom the packet was
originally addressed, the names and addresses of
those who sent it from London, the circumstances
under which it was intercepted, will be written
out with what detail is necessary, and will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
contained in the packet with the original cipher.</p>

<p class="indent">In one week from today the American Consul,
Mr. Morgan, will deliver to you this packet, but
under no circumstances is it to be delivered before
a week from today.</p>

<p class="indent">I have the honour to be, sir, with great respect,</p>

<p class="center">Your obt. serv&#39;t,</p>

<p class="right">Kervyn Guild</p>

<p class="indent">Union square, New York.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">This letter he sealed, addressed, and laid aside.</p>

<p class="indent">He then wrote to the American Consulate, addressing
the note to the Consul and Vice-Consul, saying
that he committed to their care&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">1st. A letter to be called for immediately by the
British Consul in person, and so marked.</p>

<p class="indent">2d. A packet addressed to the British Consul,
but not to be delivered until a week had expired.</p>

<p class="indent">3d. A letter to be sent to the United States
Consul General in London with all speed.</p>

<p class="indent">4th. A telegram to be sent to Edmeston Automobile
Agency in London.</p>

<p class="indent">5th. A letter to the same agency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">He then wrote out his telegram, wondering whether
the United States Consul could put it through:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Edmeston Agency,</span><br />
<span class="i2">White Hood Lane,</span><br />
<span class="i2">London, E. C.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Business of instant importance requires you all
to leave for Holland immediately. Lose no time.</p>

<p class="right">Signed&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rider</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">Holland Line S. S. <i>Feyenoord</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
The letter was directed to the Edmeston Agency:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sirs</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">Grätz and Bush must leave at once if they wish
to enjoy the fishing here. The <i>pike</i> are biting.
<i>Four have been caught. The shooting, also, is excellent.
Eight birds were killed yesterday.</i> If
Grätz and Bush do not leave within a week business
in London is likely to detain them indefinitely
and they will miss their holiday with little chance
for another.</p>

<p class="indent">Tell them to take the urgent advice of a sportsman
and clear out while they have the chance.</p>

<p class="center">Yours with good intentions,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">D. Brown Satchell</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">While Guild was busy writing and consigning what he
had written to separate envelopes, he was aware of considerable
movement and noise outside on deck&mdash;the
passing to and fro of many people, whistle blasts from
other craft&mdash;in fact, all the various species of bustle
and noise which, aboard any steamer, indicate its approach
to port.</p>

<p class="indent">He raised his head and tried to see, but it was still
raining and the air was dull with fog.</p>

<p class="indent">Passengers, stewards, and officers came and went,
passing through the writing-room where he sat in a
corner sorting and sealing his letters. Twice, glancing
up over his shoulder, he noticed a steward cleaning up,
dusting and arranging the pens, ink, and writing paper
on the several tables near by&mdash;one of those too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
busy and officious functionaries whose zeal for tips usually
defeats its own ends.</p>

<p class="indent">And so it happened this time, for, as Guild, intent on
what he was writing, reached out absently for another
envelope, a package of them was thrust into his hand
with a bustling, obsequious&mdash;"Paper, sir! Yes, sir"&mdash;Beg
pardon, sir! I&#39;m sorry!"&mdash;For somehow the inkwell
had been upset and the pile of letters scattered over
the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">"Damn it!" said Guild savagely, springing back to
avoid the streaming ink.</p>

<p class="indent">The steward appeared to be overwhelmed; down he
flopped on his knees to collect the letters, hopping up at
intervals to sop the flowing flood of ink from the desk.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild took the letters from him grimly, counted the
sealed envelopes, then without a word went to the neighbouring
desk, and, sitting down there, wrote on the last
sealed envelope not yet addressed&mdash;the envelope which
contained the cipher code, translation, and the information
concerning the Edmeston Company. When he
had written on it: "To be delivered to the British Consul
in a week," he gathered all the letters, placed them
in his breast pocket, buttoned his coat, and went out.
For half an hour he walked to and fro under the shelter
of the roofed deck, glancing absently across the rail
where there was nothing to see except grey mist, grey
water, and rain.</p>

<p class="indent">After he had enough of this he went below.</p>

<p class="indent">Karen was not in the cabin, but her luggage stood
there beside his own.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
He had plenty of time to make a decent toilet; he
bathed, shaved, chose fresh linen, brushed his wrinkled
tweeds as thoroughly as he could, then, leaving the luggage
there he went away in search of Karen with a view
to breakfast.</p>

<p class="indent">He found her on the starboard deck very comfortably
established. The idiot deck steward who had upset his
ink-well and scattered his letters was serving her obsequiously
with marmalade.</p>

<p class="indent">As Guild approached Karen looked up at him coolly
enough, though a bright colour surged into her face.
The steward bustled away to find more coffee and rolls.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you feel rested at all?" asked Guild pleasantly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, thank you."</p>

<p class="indent">"May I take the next chair and have breakfast with
you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, please."</p>

<p class="indent">He seated himself. She said nothing, ate nothing.
Suddenly it occurred to him that in her quaint way
she was waiting for his breakfast to appear before beginning
her own.</p>

<p class="indent">"You are not waiting for me, are you?" he asked.
"Don&#39;t do that; everything will be cold."</p>

<p class="indent">With an odd air of old-fashioned obedience, which
always seemed to make her more youthful to him, she
began her breakfast.</p>

<p class="indent">"We&#39;ll be docking presently," he remarked, glancing
out into the fog and thinly falling rain.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">He lay back in his chair, not caring for her monosyllables,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
but good-humouredly receptive in case she encouraged
conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">Neither the freshness of her clothes nor of her skin
seemed to have suffered from the discomforts of the
night; her hair was lustrous and crisply in order. From
her hat-crown to the palms of her gloves rolled back
over her wrists, she seemed to have just left the hands
of a clever maid, so fresh, sweet, fragrant and immaculate
she appeared to him, and he became uncomfortably
conscious of his knickerbockers and badly wrinkled
tweeds.</p>

<p class="indent">The same fool of a steward brought his coffee. And
as Karen offered no encouragement to conversation he
breakfasted beside her in silence.</p>

<p class="indent">Afterward he lighted a cigarette, and they both lay
back on their steamer chairs watching the fog and the
drizzle and the promenading passengers who all appeared
to be excited at the approaching process of docking
and over the terrible episode of the previous night.</p>

<p class="indent">In all languages it was being discussed; Guild could
catch fragments of conversation as groups formed,
passed, and repassed their chairs.</p>

<p class="indent">Another thing was plain to him; Karen had absolutely
nothing to say to him, and apparently no further
interest in him.</p>

<p class="indent">From time to time he looked at the pure profile which
never turned in response. Self-possessed, serene, the
girl gazed out into the fog as though she were quite
alone on deck. Nor did there seem to be any effort in
her detached interest from her environment. And Guild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
wondered in his depressed heart whether he had utterly
and hopelessly killed in her the last faint glimmer of
friendly interest in him.</p>

<p class="indent">The docking of the <i>Feyenoord</i> in the fog interested
him very little; here and there a swaying mast or a
black and red funnel loomed up in the fog, and the air
was full of characteristic noises&mdash;that is all he saw
or heard where he lay silent, brooding on fate and
chance and on the ways of a woman in the pride of her
youth.</p>

<p class="indent">The idiot steward reappeared and Guild sent him below
for their luggage.</p>

<p class="indent">On the gang-plank they descended with the throng,
shoulder to shoulder in silence. Inspection did not take
long; then a porter who had been following took their
luggage.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen, do you speak Dutch?" asked Guild, mischievously.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;a little."</p>

<p class="indent">"I supposed you did," he said smilingly. "Please
ask him the shortest way to the United States Consulate."</p>

<p class="indent">She turned indifferently to the porter: "Wat is de
Kortste weg naar&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">She hesitated, then with a dainty malice indescribable&mdash;"&mdash;Naar
the Yankee Consulate?" she added
calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild reddened and strolled a few steps forward, thoroughly
incensed.</p>

<p class="indent">The porter smothered a smile: "Mejuffrouw&mdash;" he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
began, "ga recht uit links, en den de derde Straat
rechts&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Hoe ver is het?"</p>

<p class="indent">The porter glanced sideways and cunningly after
Guild, then sank his voice: "Freule&mdash;" he began, but
the girl&#39;s haughty amazement silenced him. He touched
his cap and muttered in English: "Madam is known to
me. The chain is long from London to Trois Fontaines.
I am only another link in that chain&mdash;at madam&#39;s
service."</p>

<p class="indent">"I <i>am</i> served&mdash;sufficiently. Find a motor cab and
tell the driver to take us to the United States Consulate."</p>

<p class="indent">The porter&#39;s visage expressed sullen curiosity:
"Why," he asked in German, "does the gracious, well-born
young lady desire to visit the <i>American</i> Consulate
when the German Consulate is possibly expecting her?"</p>

<p class="indent">At that she straightened up, staring at the man out
of coldly insolent eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"That is enough," she said. "Take our luggage to
a motor cab."</p>

<p class="indent">"To the Yankee Consulate?"</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>To the Consulate of the United States!</i> Do you
hear? Move, then!" she said crisply.</p>

<p class="indent">It was raining torrents; Guild held the sullen porter&#39;s
umbrella while Karen entered the cab; the luggage was
stowed, the vehicle wheeled out into rain-shot obscurity.</p>

<p class="indent">Karen turned impulsively to the man beside her:
"Forgive my rudeness; I am ashamed to have insulted
your Consulate."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
He flushed, but his lips twitched humorously; "I am
sure that the United States very freely forgives Fräulein
Girard."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Does it matter?" he asked lightly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. Are my amends acceptable to <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course. But what am I&mdash;Karen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"You are&mdash;amiable. It was very common of me."</p>

<p class="indent">"It might have been rather common in anybody else.
You couldn&#39;t be <i>that</i>. Somehow," he added, smiling,
"as we say in America, you seem to get away with it,
Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">"You are very&mdash;amiable," she repeated stiffly.</p>

<p class="indent">And constraint fell between them once more, leaving
him, however, faintly amused. She <i>could</i> be such a
<i>little</i> girl at times. And she was adorable in the rôle,
though she scarcely suspected it.</p>

<p class="indent">At the American Consulate the cab stopped and Guild
turned up his coat collar and sprang out.</p>

<p class="indent">While he was absent the girl lay back in her corner,
her eyes fixed on the rain-smeared pane. She had remained
so motionless for some time when a tapping at
the cabin window attracted her attention. A beggar
had come to the street side of the cab and was standing
there, the rain beating on his upturned face. And the
girl hastily drew out her purse and let down the window.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly she became rigid; the beggar had said
something to her under his breath. The English shilling
fell from her fingers to the floor of the cab.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
His hand still extended in supplication, the man went
on in German:</p>

<p class="indent">"Your steamer swarmed with English spies. One of
them was your stewardess."</p>

<p class="indent">The girl&#39;s lips parted, stiffly: "I don&#39;t understand,"
she said with an effort.</p>

<p class="indent">"The stewardess spied on the deck steward, Ridder.
They were all watching each other on that ship. And
everybody watched you and the American. Ridder told
me to follow you to the American Consulate."</p>

<p class="indent">"Who are <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I served as one of the waiters in the saloon. Grätz
knows me. If you are carrying any papers of value
be careful."</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you mean?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ridder gave you some papers. The stewardess saw
him. She came ashore and watched you while your luggage
was being inspected. She knows you have driven
to the American Consulate. Your porter told her&mdash;the
fool! Do you know what she is up to?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;I can&mdash;guess. I think you had better go&mdash;quick!"
she added as the Consulate door opened and
Guild came out. And she fumbled in her purse for a
coin, thrust it hastily through the window, and turned
in confusion to meet the young man&#39;s sternly questioning
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"What are you doing?" he asked bluntly.</p>

<p class="indent">"A man&mdash;begging."</p>

<p class="indent">"For what, Karen? For money or information?"</p>

<p class="indent">The girl winced and avoided his gaze. The cab
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
wheeled in a short circle and moved off through the rain
again.</p>

<p class="indent">"Which was it he wanted, Karen?" repeated Guild
quietly. "Was it money or&mdash;something else he wanted?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Does&mdash;it&mdash;concern you?" she stammered.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. Because I have just learned over the Consulate
telephone that German agents are now attempting to
do what you refrained from doing last night."</p>

<p class="indent">"What?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Steal the papers I had of you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you mean the papers you <i>stole</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I mean the papers I took by highway robbery.
There is a difference," he added. "But both are robbery,
and I thought <i>you</i> were above such things."</p>

<p class="indent">"I am!" she said, flushing.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, you are not!" he retorted sternly. "What you
were too fastidious to do for yourself last night&mdash;take
the papers when you thought I was asleep&mdash;you had
done for you this morning by a steward!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I did <i>not</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why do you deny it? What do you mean? Don&#39;t
you know that while I was busy in the writing-room a
steward upset my ink, scattered my papers, stole the
envelope containing the papers I took from you, and
left me a sealed envelope full of tissue paper?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It isn&#39;t true!"</p>

<p class="indent">"It is true."</p>

<p class="indent">"How do you know?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Your stewardess told me over the telephone a few
moments ago. Karen, you are untruthful!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
She caught her breath; the tears flushed in her eyes:</p>

<p class="indent">"I am <i>not</i> untruthful! It does look like it but I am
not! I did not know that the deck steward had robbed
you. He came to my door and gave me the papers,
saying that he had picked them up in the corridor outside
our&mdash;my&mdash;door! I did not engage anybody to
steal them&mdash;if it <i>is</i> stealing to recover&mdash;my own&mdash;property&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"That deck steward is a spy, but I don&#39;t understand
how he could have known that I had taken the papers
from you."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know either," she said excitedly. "But everybody
knew everything on board that ship. It was a
nest of spies."</p>

<p class="indent">His grim features relaxed. "I&#39;m sorry I charged you
with untruth, Karen. I never shall again. But&mdash;what
was I to think?"</p>

<p class="indent">"When I tell you a thing&mdash;<i>that</i> is what you are to
think," she said crisply.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes.... I realize that now. I am sorry. May
I ask your forgiveness?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;please."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then&mdash;I do ask it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Accorded."</p>

<p class="indent">"May I ask a little more?" he continued.</p>

<p class="indent">"What?"</p>

<p class="indent">"May I ask you to tell me what you did with those
papers after the deck steward gave them to you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall not tell you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then I am afraid that I shall have to tell you how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
you disposed of those papers. You first went to the
stewardess and borrowed a needle and thread and then
asked permission to sit in her room and do a little
necessary sewing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">The girl blushed hotly: "The contemptible creature!"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p class="indent">"A little sewing," repeated Guild, coolly. "And," he
continued, "you sewed those papers to your clothing.
The stewardess saw you do it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well! Suppose I did."</p>

<p class="indent">"You have them on you now."</p>

<p class="indent">"And then?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why it was a silly thing to do, Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">"Silly? Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because," he said calmly, "I must have them, and
it makes it more awkward for us both than if you had
merely put them back into your satchel."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&mdash;you intend&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;" Her amazement checked
her, then flashed out into wrath.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you know," she said, "that you are becoming
impudent?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen," he retorted very quietly, "a man of my sort
isn&#39;t <i>impudent</i>. But, possibly, he might be <i>insolent</i>&mdash;if
he chooses. And perhaps I shall choose."</p>

<p class="indent">Checked, her lips still quivering, the girl, despite her
anger, understood what he meant&mdash;knew that she was
confronting a man of her own caste, where insolence
indeed might happen, but nothing more plebeian.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;spoke to you as though you were an American,"
she said slowly. "I forgot&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
"I am answering you as an American!" he interrupted
drily. "Make no mistake about that country; it breeds
plenty of men who have every right to answer you as
I do!"</p>

<p class="indent">She bit her lip; her eyes filled and she averted her
face. Presently the cab stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">"We&#39;re at the station," he said briefly.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Whether Guild had paid for the entire compartment
or whether it happened so she did not inquire, but they
had the place to themselves, so far.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild paid no further attention to her except to lay
a couple of Tauchnitz novels beside her on the seat.
After that he opened a newspaper which he had brought
away with him from the Consulate, and began to read it
without troubling to ask her permission.</p>

<p class="indent">As the paper hid his perfectly expressionless face she
ventured to glance at it from time to time. It was the
<i>New York Herald</i> and on the sheet turned toward her
she was perfectly able to read something that interested
her and sent faint shivers creeping over her as she
ended it:</p>

<p class="right">Herald Bureau,<br />
No. 130 Fleet Street,<br />
London, Tuesday.</p>

<p class="indent">The United States Government&#39;s sweeping new
order requiring every American travelling in Europe
to go through a cross-examination before an
American diplomatic or consular officer came as a
bolt from the blue today. It caused widespread
comment, though it is recognized that the measure
is necessary to checkmate German spies impersonating
American travellers.</p>

<p class="indent">There is no criticism of this drastic order,
which it is recognized is probably issued to comply
with Sir Edward Grey&#39;s communication concerning
German secret agents posing as American citizens.
But many Americans want to know who is responsible
for the apparent wholesale issuance of
fraudulent American passports to Germans. The
result is that now an American passport is not
worth the paper it is written on unless backed up
by a photograph of the bearer, a description of
where he is going, what he is going for, how long
he is going to stay and so forth.</p>

<p class="indent">American embassies in European capitals today
are circulating broadcast warnings to all
Americans to consult the nearest diplomatic or
consular officer before undertaking any voyage.</p>

<p class="indent">All Americans must understand that henceforth
a passport does not mean permission to
travel in Europe. They must have written and
vouched for proof that they are not German spies
before they can feel safe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span></p>

<p class="indent">It is all the result of too free issuance of American
passports at the outbreak of the war, coupled
with German quickness to profit by American
leniency in this respect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Before the train started a commissionaire appeared,
hurrying. He opened the door of their compartment,
set a pretty basket inside, which was to be removed at
the first station beyond.</p>

<p class="indent">The basket contained a very delicious luncheon, and
Karen looked up shyly but gratefully as Guild set about
unpacking the various dishes. There was salad, chicken,
rolls and butter, a pâté, some very wonderful pastry,
fruit, and a bottle of Moselle that looked like liquid
sunshine.</p>

<p class="indent">There was one pasteboard box which Guild gave to
her without opening it. She untied the violet ribbon,
opened it, sat silent. He seemed to pay no attention
to what she was doing.</p>

<p class="indent">After a moment she lifted out the cluster of violet-scented
orchids, drew the long pin from them, and
fastened them to her blouse.</p>

<p class="indent">"Thank you&mdash;very much," she said shyly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you care for orchids?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes ... I am a little&mdash;surprised."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"That you should&mdash;think to offer them&mdash;to <i>me</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He looked up, and his grey eyes seemed to be laughing,
but his mouth&mdash;that perplexing, humorous, inscrutable
mouth of his remained grave and determined.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
"Karen," he said, "if you only understood how much
I do like you, you wouldn&#39;t perhaps deal so mercilessly
with me."</p>

<p class="indent">"I? Merciless?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You are. You made me use force with you when
you should not have resisted. And now you have done
something more merciless yet."</p>

<p class="indent">"W&mdash;what, Kervyn?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You know ... I must have those papers."</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Dear&mdash;look at me. No&mdash;in the eyes. Now look
at me while I say, as seriously and as gently as I know
how, that <i>I am going to have those papers</i>!... You
know I mean what I say.... That is all&mdash;dear."</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes fell and she looked at her orchids.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why do you speak that way to me&mdash;after giving
me these?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What have orchids to do with a man&#39;s duty?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why did you give them to me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why? Because we are friends, if you will let us be."</p>

<p class="indent">"I was willing&mdash;am still&mdash;in spite of&mdash;everything.
You know I am. If I can forgive you what you did to
me in our stateroom last night, surely, surely Kervyn,
you won&#39;t take any more chances with my forgiveness&mdash;will
you?"</p>

<p class="indent">He said: "I shall have to if you force me to it.
Karen&mdash;I never liked any woman as much as I like you.
We have known each other two days and a night. But
in that time we both have lived a long, long time."</p>

<p class="indent">She nodded, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
"Then&mdash;you know me now as well as you ever will
know me. Better than any other woman has ever known
me. When my mind is made up that a certain thing is
to be done, I always try to do it, Karen.... And I
know that I ought to have those papers.... And
that I am going to have them. Is that clear&mdash;Karen,
dear?"</p>

<p class="indent">She remained silent, brushing her orchids with her
finger-tips, absent-eyed, serene. After a moment he
thought that the ghost of a smile was hovering on her
lips, but he was not sure.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently she looked up:</p>

<p class="indent">"Shall we lunch?" she asked.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE DAY OF WRATH</h3>

<p class="indent">Three times they were obliged to change cars
after passing through Utrecht. Night fell; the
last compartment into which they had been
crowded was filled with Dutch cavalry officers, big,
talkative fellows in their field uniforms and jingling
equipments, civil to Guild, courteous to Karen, and all
intensely interested in the New York newspaper which
Guild offered them and which they all appeared to be
quite able to read.</p>

<p class="indent">They all got out at Maastricht, where the lantern-lit
platform was thronged with soldiers; and, when the
train started, the two were alone together once more.</p>

<p class="indent">They had been seated side by side when the officers
were occupying the compartment; they remained so
when the train rolled out of the station, neither offering
to move, perhaps not thinking to move.</p>

<p class="indent">Karen&#39;s Tauchnitz novel lay open on her lap, her
eyes brooded over the pages, but the light was very dim
and presently she lay back, resting her arm on the upholstered
window ledge.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild had been sitting so very still beside her that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
she suspected he was asleep. And when she was sure
of it she permitted herself closer scrutiny of his features
than she had ever ventured.</p>

<p class="indent">Curiosity was uppermost. To inspect at her leisure
a man who had so stirred, so dominated, so ruled and
misruled her was most interesting.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked very boyish, she thought, as he lay there&mdash;very
clear cut and yellow-haired&mdash;very kind&mdash;except
for the rather square contour of the chin. But the
mouth had relaxed from its sternly quiet curve into
pleasant lines.</p>

<p class="indent">One hand lay on his knees; it was clenched; the other
rested inert on the cushioned seat beside her, listless,
harmless.</p>

<p class="indent">Was that the hand of iron that had closed around her
shoulders, pinning both her arms helpless? Were these
the hands that had mastered her without effort&mdash;the
hands which had taken what they chose to take, gently
violent, unhurried, methodical and inexorable?</p>

<p class="indent">How was it that her swift hatred had not endured
in the wake of this insolent outrage? Never before had
a hand been laid on her in violence&mdash;not even in reproof.
How was it that she had endured this? Every womanly
instinct had been outraged. How was it that she was
enduring it still?&mdash;acquiescing in this man&#39;s presence
here in the same compartment with her&mdash;close beside
her? She had resented the humiliation. She resented
it still, fiercely&mdash;when she remembered it. Why didn&#39;t
she remember it more frequently? Why didn&#39;t she
think of it every time she looked at him? What was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
the trouble with her anger that she seemed to forget so
often that she had ever been angry?</p>

<p class="indent">Was she spiritless? Had his violence then crippled
her pride forever? Was this endurance, this submission,
this tacit condoning of an unforgivable offense to
continue?</p>

<p class="indent">There was colour in her cheeks now as she sat there
gazing at him and remembering her wrongs, and industriously
fanning the rather sickly flames of her
wrath into something resembling a reasonable glow.</p>

<p class="indent">But more fuel seemed to be needed for that; the mental
search for it seemed to require a slight effort. But
she made it and found her fuel&mdash;and a brighter colour
stained her face.</p>

<p class="indent">Dared he lay hands on her again! What did his
recent threat mean? He was aware that she had sewed
the papers to her clothing. What did he mean by warning
her that he would take them by violence again if
necessary? It was unthinkable! inconceivable! She
shivered unconsciously and cast a rather scared glance
at him&mdash;this man was not a Hun! She was no Sabine!
The era of Pluto and Proserpine had perhaps been comprehensible
considering the times&mdash;even picturesque, if
the galleries of Europe correctly reflected the episode.
But such things were not done in 1914.</p>

<p class="indent">They were not only not done but the mere menace
of them was monstrous&mdash;unbelievably brutal. She
needed more fuel, caught her breath, and cast about for
it to stoke the flames before her flushed cheeks could cool.</p>

<p class="indent">And to think&mdash;to <i>think</i> that she, Karen, was actually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
at that moment wearing his orchids&mdash;here at her breast!
Her gloved hand clenched and she made a gesture as
though to tear the blossoms from her person.... And
did not.... They were so delicate, so fresh, so fragrant....
After all the flowers were innocent. It
was not these lovely, scented little things she should
scorn and punish but the man&mdash;this man here asleep
beside her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Her heart almost ceased for a moment; he moved,
opened his eyes, and lay looking at her, his lids still
heavy with sleep.</p>

<p class="indent">"You are horribly tired&mdash;aren&#39;t you?" she faltered,
looking into his worn face which two days&#39; lack of sleep
had made haggard.</p>

<p class="indent">He nodded, watching her.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll move across the way and let you stretch out,"
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"No&mdash;you need not."</p>

<p class="indent">"You look dead tired."</p>

<p class="indent">"I couldn&#39;t sleep that way. You&mdash;need not&mdash;move."</p>

<p class="indent">He nodded; his eyes closed. After he had been asleep
a little while, watching him, she wondered what he might
be dreaming, for a ghost of a smile edged his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, sleeping, his arm moved, encircled her, drew
her shoulder against his. And she found herself yielding,
guided, relaxing, assenting, until her cheek lay
against his shoulder, resting there. And after a while
her eyes closed.</p>

<p class="indent">The fuel had given out. After a little while the last
spark died. And she slept.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>HER ENEMY</h3>

<p class="indent">The dim light fell on them where they slept seated
upright, unconscious, swaying as the car swayed.
Unseen forests swept past on either side under
a dark sky set with stars; low mountains loomed
in the night, little rivers sparkled under trestles for
a second and vanished in the dull roar of the rushing
train.</p>

<p class="indent">The man, sunk back against the upholstered seat, lay
as though dead.</p>

<p class="indent">But after a while the girl dreamed. It was the frontier
toward which they were rushing through the night&mdash;a
broad white road running between meadows set with
flowers, such as she had often seen.</p>

<p class="indent">Two painted sentry boxes stood on either side of the
boundary; the one on her side was empty, but in the
other she realized that her enemy was on guard, hidden,
watching her.</p>

<p class="indent">She desired to cross. In all her life never had she
so longed for anything as she longed to cross that still,
sunny, flower-bordered frontier.</p>

<p class="indent">She dared not. Her enemy stood hidden, armed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
watching her from within that painted sentry box. She
knew it. She was afraid. She knew that her enemy
would step out with weapon levelled and challenge her
the instant she set foot across that flowering frontier.
She was afraid of his challenge, afraid even to learn
what her enemy might look like.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet she <i>must</i> cross. Something had to be done&mdash;something
had to be done while the sun was shining and
the breeze in the meadow set the flowers all swaying.
She looked desperately at the silent sentry box. Nothing
moved. Yet she knew her enemy was watching her.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, frightened, she set one foot across the line&mdash;took
one more step, very timidly.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Halt! Who goes there?</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">She knew it&mdash;she <i>knew</i> it! It had come&mdash;it had happened
to her at last!</p>

<p class="indent">"F-friend!" she faltered&mdash;"but I do not know the
countersign."</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Pass, friend, without the countersign!</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">Could she believe her ears!</p>

<p class="indent">She listened again, her hand resting against her
heart. But she only heard a child laughing inside the
sentry box, and the smothered ruffle of preening wings.</p>

<p class="indent">Her dream partly awoke her; she lay very still,
vaguely conscious of where her cheek was resting, then
closed her eyes to seek her enemy again among her
dreams.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>IN CONFIDENCE</h3>

<p class="indent">They awoke with a light shining in their eyes;
the guard stood on the running rail, one hand
on the knob of the door.</p>

<p class="indent">"The frontier," he said. "Descend if you please for
the customs, and kindly have your papers ready."</p>

<p class="indent">The girl&#39;s blue eyes were sleepy and humorous as
she rested her hand on his arm to rise.</p>

<p class="indent">"Are we ever to have a good night&#39;s sleep again?"
she murmured as he aided her to descend in the lantern-lit
darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s our punishment," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"For what, please?"</p>

<p class="indent">"For ever doubting each other."</p>

<p class="indent">She said nothing. A soldier picked up their luggage
and carried it across the platform where another train
stood waiting.</p>

<p class="indent">And all at once Guild realized that the soldiers
around the station and custom-house were not Belgians
but Germans. He had forgotten that, and it gave him
a distinct shock.</p>

<p class="indent">As he and Karen, following the soldier, entered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
long room in the custom-house, an officer all in sea-grey
from the shrouded spike on his helmet to his ankles came
forward and saluted; and Guild coolly lifted his cap.</p>

<p class="indent">"Have I by chance the honour of addressing Herr
Guild?" asked the officer.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am Herr Guild."</p>

<p class="indent">"And&mdash;gnädiges Fräulein?"&mdash;at salute and very
rigid.</p>

<p class="indent">"Fräulein Girard."</p>

<p class="indent">"The gracious young lady has credentials?&mdash;a ring,
perhaps?"</p>

<p class="indent">Karen drew off her glove, slipped the ring from her
finger. A soldier held up a lantern; the lieutenant adjusted
a single eye-glass, scrutinized the ring, returned
it with a tight-waisted bow.</p>

<p class="indent">"Papers in order!" he said, turning to the customs
officials. "Pass that luggage without inspection!"</p>

<p class="indent">He was very polite. He escorted them to the Belgian
train, found an empty compartment for them,
thanked them with empressement, and retired into the
darkness which had hatched him.</p>

<p class="indent">As the train started Karen said in a low voice:
"Would you care to call that officer a barbarian, Kervyn?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You haven&#39;t seen Louvain. But probably that officer
has&mdash;through his monocle."</p>

<p class="indent">She sighed. "Are we to&mdash;differ again? I am <i>so</i>
sleepy."</p>

<p class="indent">This time he was entirely awake and responsible for
his actions. So was she. But she was really very tired,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
she remembered, when conscience began to make her
uncomfortable and call her to account.</p>

<p class="indent">But she was too weary to argue the point; her cheek
rested unstirring against his shoulder; once or twice
her eyes opened vaguely, and her hand crept toward
the orchids at her breast. But they had not been
crushed. Her white lids closed again. It was unfortunate
that she felt no desire to sleep. Her conscience
continued to meddle at intervals, too.</p>

<p class="indent">But of one thing she was quite certain&mdash;she would not
have tolerated any such thing very long had she not
been very sure that he had immediately gone to sleep....
And she was afraid that if she stirred he might
awake.... And perhaps might not be able to go to
sleep again.... He needed sleep. She told herself
this several times.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What?" she said in consternation. And she felt her
cheeks growing hot.</p>

<p class="indent">"You <i>will</i> let me have those papers, won&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">She lay very still against his shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">"Won&#39;t you?" he repeated in a low and very gentle
voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Please sleep," she said in a voice as low.</p>

<p class="indent">"Won&#39;t you answer me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You need sleep <i>so</i> much!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Please answer me, Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">"You know," she said, "that unless you let me sleep
I&mdash;couldn&#39;t rest&mdash;like this. Don&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you not comfortable?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
"Yes.... But that has nothing to do with it. You
know it."</p>

<p class="indent">He murmured something which she did not catch.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t <i>care</i> to rest this way if we are going to remain
awake," she whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am asleep," he replied, drowsily.</p>

<p class="indent">Whether or not he was, she could not be certain even
after a long while. But, in argument with her conscience
again, she thought she ought to take the chance
that he was asleep because, if he were, it would be inhuman
of her to lift her head and arouse him.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile the train moved ahead at a fair speed, not
very fast, but without stopping. Other trains gave it
right of way, hissing on sidings&mdash;even military and
supply trains which operated within the zone controlled
by General von Reiter&#39;s division. The locomotive carried
several lanterns of various colours. They were
sufficient to clear the track for that train through that
strip of Belgium to the Luxembourg frontier.</p>

<p class="indent">Hills, woods, mountain streams, stretches of ferny
uplands, gullies set with beech and hazel flew by under
the watching stars.</p>

<p class="indent">Over the fields to the west lay what had been Liège.
But they swung east through Herve, past Ensival, then
south by Theux, Stavelot, over the headwaters of the
Ourthe.</p>

<p class="indent">Forest trees almost swept the window panes at times;
lonely hamlets lay unlighted in darkened valleys. Karen&#39;s
blue eyes were shut and she did not see these
things. As for Guild he lay very still, wondering how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
he was to get the papers&mdash;wondering, too, what it was
about this girl that was making this headlong, nerve-racking
quest of his the most interesting and most wonderful
journey he had ever undertaken.</p>

<p class="indent">They were not asleep, but they should have been. And
in separate corners. Conscience was explaining this to
her and she was really trying to find relief in sleep.
Conscience was less intrusive with him, except in regard
to the papers. And when it had nagged him enough
he ceased wondering how he was going to get them and
merely admitted that he would do it.</p>

<p class="indent">And this self-knowledge disturbed him so that he
could scarcely endure to think of the matter and of
what must happen to their friendship in the end. Sorrow,
dismay, tenderness possessed him by turns. She
seemed like a slumbering child there on his shoulder,
softly fragrant, trustful, pathetic. And he was pledged
to a thing that might tear the veil from her eyes&mdash;horrify
her, crush her confidence in man.</p>

<p class="indent">"I can bribe a couple of old women," he thought miserably&mdash;"but
it&#39;s almost as bad as though I did it myself.
Good Heavens!&mdash;was a man ever before placed in
such a predicament?"</p>

<p class="indent">And when he couldn&#39;t stand his horrid reflections any
longer he said, "Karen?" again. So humbly, so unhappily
that the girl opened her blue eyes very wide and
listened with all her might.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen," he said, "in a comparatively short time you
won&#39;t listen to me at all&mdash;you won&#39;t tolerate me. And
before that time is upon us, I&mdash;I want to say a&mdash;few&mdash;words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
to you ... about how deeply I value our friendship....
And about my very real respect and admiration
for you.... You won&#39;t let me say it, soon.
You won&#39;t care to hear it. You will scorn the very mention
of my name&mdash;hate me, possibly&mdash;no, probably....
And so now&mdash;before I have irrevocably angered you&mdash;before
I have incurred your&mdash;dislike&mdash;I want to say&mdash;if
I may&mdash;that I&mdash;never was as unhappy in all my
life."</p>

<p class="indent">Lying very still against his shoulder she thought:
"He does not really mean to do it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen," he went on, "if you don&#39;t find it in your
heart to spare me this&mdash;duty&mdash;how can I spare myself?"</p>

<p class="indent">She thought: "He <i>does</i> mean to do it."</p>

<p class="indent">"And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"He won&#39;t do it!" she thought.</p>

<p class="indent">"There never has been a coward in my race!" he
said more calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">"He <i>does</i> mean to do it!" she thought. "He is a barbarian,
a Hun, a Visigoth, a savage! He is a brute, all
through. And I&mdash;I don&#39;t know what I am becoming&mdash;resting
here&mdash;listening to such&mdash;such infamy from
him! I don&#39;t know what is going to become of me&mdash;I
don&#39;t&mdash;I <i>don&#39;t!</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">She caught her breath like a hurt child, hot tears
welled up; she turned and buried her face against his
arm, overwhelmed by her own toleration of herself and
the man she was learning so quickly to endure, to fear,
and to care for with all the capacity of a heart and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
mind that had never before submitted one atom of either
mind or heart to any man.</p>

<p class="indent">What had happened to her? What possessed her?
What was bewitching her that from the first instant
she had laid eyes on him she seemed to realize she belonged
with him&mdash;beside him! And now&mdash;now a more
terrifying knowledge threatened, menaced her&mdash;the
vague, obscure, formless idea that she belonged to him.</p>

<p class="indent">Did it mean she was in love! Was <i>this</i> love? It
couldn&#39;t be. Love came differently. It was a happiness,
a delight, a firm and abiding faith, a sunburst
of self-revelation and self-knowledge. It wasn&#39;t tears
and conscience and bewilderment, and self-reproach&mdash;and
a haunting fear of self&mdash;and a constantly throttled
dismay at her own capability for informality&mdash;the informality,
for example, of her present attitude! And
she wept anew at her own astounding degradation.</p>

<p class="indent">Love? No, indeed. But a dreadful, unaccountable
exposure of her own unaccountable capacity for familiarity!
That was it. She was common&mdash;common at
heart, common by instinct. She had thought she had
a will of her own. It seemed she had not. She had
nothing!&mdash;nothing admirable in her&mdash;neither quality
nor fineness nor courage nor intellect. It must be so,
or how could she be where she was, blotting her tears
against the shoulder of a man she had known two days!&mdash;biting
at her quivering lip in silence there, miserable,
bewildered, lonely&mdash;lonely beyond belief.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">She made the effort, failed, tried again:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
"Yes," she managed to say.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t cry any more."</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"Because I don&#39;t mean to make you unhappy."</p>

<p class="indent">"No-o&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"But I must have those papers&mdash;mustn&#39;t I?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Y-yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"But you are not going to give them to me, are you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No-o."</p>

<p class="indent">"And I am not going to&mdash;to tear you to pieces, am
I?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No-o-o&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"And yet I <i>must</i> have them, mustn&#39;t I?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"You know I am going to get them, don&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"How do you think I am going to do it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I d-don&#39;t know."</p>

<p class="indent">"I think I know one way."</p>

<p class="indent">She remained silent.</p>

<p class="indent">"It is quite a wonderful way ... if it could occur&mdash;happen,
come about."</p>

<p class="indent">She said nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know&mdash;I don&#39;t know&mdash;I won&#39;t think about
it any more ... for a while.... It&#39;s too important
to think about ... in that way ... if it is going
to be important at all.... I don&#39;t know exactly
what I&#39;m saying, Karen. I seem to be thinking out
loud.... The idea came ... and then remained....
You won&#39;t cry any more, will you?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"I frightened you, didn&#39;t I?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No.... Yes.... Not exactly."</p>

<p class="indent">"You know," he said, "I don&#39;t understand you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not clearly.... Do you care a little for me,
still?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know&mdash;how I feel."</p>

<p class="indent">"Could you care for me&mdash;be friends again&mdash;as
naturally and as honestly as you were once?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;trusted you. Friendship is trust."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know. I have destroyed your confidence."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;my confidence in friendship."</p>

<p class="indent">"That is a terrible thing to do," he said miserably.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. Friendship ends when distrust begins. I do
distrust you and I don&#39;t understand why&mdash;why distrusting
you makes me care for you&mdash;even more."</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I do care&mdash;more than I did. Can you explain it?"</p>

<p class="indent">He was silent, surprised and touched.</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t explain it to myself," she said. "I have been
trying to and I can&#39;t. I should detest you, but I don&#39;t.
If there is any contempt it is for myself&mdash;because I can
not feel it for you, perhaps. I think it&#39;s that. I don&#39;t
know. The years we have lived together in these two
days must account for my liking you.... Not altogether,
because it began in the beginning when you
came to Hyacinth Villa.... And it&#39;s been so all the
time."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not all the time. Not in our stateroom."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
"Yes&mdash;even there."</p>

<p class="indent">"When I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes! Yes! Isn&#39;t it degrading? Isn&#39;t it unaccountable&mdash;terrible!
I&#39;m frightened I tell you. I am afraid
that whatever you do&mdash;will not&mdash;change me."</p>

<p class="indent">There was no emotion in her young voice, only an
accentless admission of facts with a candour and directness
that silenced him.</p>

<p class="indent">After a moment she went on, without emphasis, and
thoughtfully, as though in self-communion to make
things clearer to herself:</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m really well born. You might be pardoned for
not thinking so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Your father is of that caste."</p>

<p class="indent">"General von Reiter is not my father."</p>

<p class="indent">"What!" he exclaimed, astounded.</p>

<p class="indent">She turned her face from his shoulder and looked up
at him.</p>

<p class="indent">"He spoke to you of me as his daughter. You spoke
to me of him in that relation, too. I did not enlighten
you because it did not seem to matter. But it is not
true."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is he&mdash;your guardian?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No; I need none. My father was a German officer&mdash;of
that caste. My mother was Danish.... Something
happened&mdash;I do not know what. I was very little.
And my mother would never speak of it. She was very
beautiful. I remember her quite well. We lived in
Copenhagen.</p>

<p class="indent">"Whatever happened occurred before I was born. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
know that. Mother told me. My father dropped both
title and name and left the army and went with my
mother to Copenhagen. He took the name of his
mother who was English&mdash;Girard. I never was even
told what our name had been. Neither father nor
mother would ever speak of it."</p>

<p class="indent">She rested there silent, absent-eyed, gazing into space
as though recalling years that had not been unpleasant.
Then, serenely meeting his gaze, she smiled up at him.</p>

<p class="indent">"You know," she said, "my life has been a happy
one. My father was a man of means. We lived very
happily in Denmark. I&#39;ve always thought of myself as
Danish.</p>

<p class="indent">"My childhood was really wonderful. I had a passion
for study, for learning; and I learn very easily&mdash;almost
without effort. And you know, perhaps, how thorough
the Danish schools are, how much they demand of a
child, physically as well as mentally.</p>

<p class="indent">"And I did everything, Kervyn; learned the accomplishments
of a young Danish girl&mdash;and was flattered
I am afraid, and perhaps spoiled.</p>

<p class="indent">"And always I desired to go on the stage&mdash;always&mdash;from
the very beginning&mdash;from the time I was first taken
to the theatre.</p>

<p class="indent">"It was quite hopeless. I did act for charity, and
at school; and afterward took lessons. But as long as
my father and mother lived that career was not possible....
Afterward I decided for myself. And first I
went to Germany and they gave me a small part in a
company that was going to Posen. And there General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
von Reiter, who had been my father&#39;s friend and
brother-officer, met me.</p>

<p class="indent">"He was very kind. He wished to adopt me and give
me his name. He was very insistent, too&mdash;a man&mdash;Kervyn,
not unlike you&mdash;in some respects. But I
never dreamed of permitting him to sway me&mdash;as
you do.</p>

<p class="indent">"He knew my desire for a stage career; he has for
three years attempted to destroy in me that desire.
When I had no engagement, or was studying, he insisted
that I stay with his brother and his brother&#39;s wife,
with whom he lived. He spoke freely of his desire and
intention of legally adopting me, called me his daughter
when he spoke to others of me&mdash;and always I felt the
constant, iron pressure of his will&mdash;always&mdash;not harshly,
but with the kindly patience of resolution.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then I decided to go to England, study, and if possible
gain some experience on the London stage.</p>

<p class="indent">"And then"&mdash;she bit her lip&mdash;"I think I may say it&mdash;to
<i>you</i>&mdash;not saying it lightly, Kervyn&mdash;then, on the
eve of my departure, he asked me to marry him.</p>

<p class="indent">"And because he would not accept my answer he exacted
of me a promise that in November I would return
to Berlin, give him my final answer, and choose then
between marrying him or a return to the profession I
care for most.</p>

<p class="indent">"That is my history, Kervyn. No man has ever figured
in it; none except General Baron von Reiter has
ever even invaded it ... until you have done so ...
and have made your wishes mine&mdash;I don&#39;t know how&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
your will my inclination&mdash;and me more than the
friend I was.</p>

<p class="indent">"One thing only you could not do&mdash;and in my heart
I know you do not wish it of me&mdash;and that is, make
me break my word&mdash;make me forget a promise.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now I have told you all," she said with a little sigh,
and lay there looking at him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not all, Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I think so."</p>

<p class="indent">"No. You have not told me what answer you mean
to make."</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes opened at that. "I am not in love. What
answer should I make?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You return to your career?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course, once my promise is kept."</p>

<p class="indent">"What promise?"</p>

<p class="indent">"To see him and tell him what I have decided."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you think he might persuade you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you sure?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Perfectly."</p>

<p class="indent">He said, looking at her with a hint of a smile in his
eyes: "Do you think I might ever persuade you to give
up your career?"</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled frankly: "I don&#39;t think so."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not if I asked?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You wouldn&#39;t do such a thing."</p>

<p class="indent">"I might if I fell in love with you."</p>

<p class="indent">She lay perfectly still, quite tranquil, looking up at
him. Suddenly her expression changed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
"Is it likely?" she said, the tint of excitement in her
cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you think so?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know. Is it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s perfectly possible I imagine."</p>

<p class="indent">"That you could fall in love with me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">After a moment she laughed as a child laughs at the
prospect of beholding wonders.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn," she said, "please do so. I will give you
every opportunity if you will remain at Trois Fontaines."</p>

<p class="indent">"I mean to remain in that vicinity," he said, meaningly;
and she laughed again, deliciously, almost maliciously.</p>

<p class="indent">"It would finish you thoroughly," she said. "It
would be poetic justice with a vengeance."</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Your</i> vengeance?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, mine. Oh, if you only <i>did</i> do that!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think, considering the way you look at it, that I&#39;d
better not," he said, rather seriously. "Besides, I&#39;ve no
time."</p>

<p class="indent">"No time to fall in love with me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No time."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Shall I tell you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, please."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well. Because after I have the papers I shall
enter the Belgian army." He added with a hint of impatience&mdash;"Where
I belong and where I ought to be now."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
She became very silent at that. After a few moments
she said: "Had you decided to do that before I
met you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. I was on my way&mdash;trying to avoid the very
trap I fell into."</p>

<p class="indent">"The German army?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">After another silence she said: "I shall be very sorry
when you go. I shall think of you when I am in England."</p>

<p class="indent">"You can&#39;t go back to England, Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">"That is true. I forgot."</p>

<p class="indent">"Where will you go?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know."</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t go to Germany."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"There may be an invasion."</p>

<p class="indent">She had lifted her head as he spoke. After a moment
she sighed like a tired child, laid her head
back on his arm and rested one slender hand on his
shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">It suddenly seemed to her that the world, which had
been going very well with her, had halted, and was
beginning to go the other way.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You could take the papers when I am asleep, I suppose.
I couldn&#39;t help it, could I?"</p>

<p class="indent">"That <i>is</i> one way," he said, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">"What was the other?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
He did not reply.</p>

<p class="indent">She sighed again. "I suggested it," she said, "in
order to give you a little more time to do&mdash;what you
said you thought&mdash;possible."</p>

<p class="indent">"Fall in love?" he asked lightly. "Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"What would be the use, Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Use?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. I&#39;m going into the army. It will be a long
war. If I fell in love with you I&#39;d not have time to
win your love in return before I went away&mdash;admitting
that I could ever win it. Do you see?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I quite see that."</p>

<p class="indent">"So I had better take the papers when I can, and
get into touch with the reserves of my regiment if I
can."</p>

<p class="indent">"What regiment?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The Guides."</p>

<p class="indent">"The Guides! Are you an officer?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, of the reserve."</p>

<p class="indent">She knew quite well what that meant. Only the Belgian
nobility of ancient lineage served as officers in the
Guides.</p>

<p class="indent">A happiness, a wonderful tranquillity crept over her.
No wonder she had found it difficult to really reproach
herself with her behaviour. And it was a most heavenly
comfort to her to know that if she had been indiscreet,
at least she had been misbehaving with one of her own
caste.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">"The next station," said the German guard, squinting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
in at them from the window under his lifted lantern,
"is Trois Fontaines."</p>

<p class="indent">"What!" exclaimed Guild surprised. "Have we
passed the customs?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The customs? This is a German military train!
What business is it of the Grand Duchy where we go
or what we do?"</p>

<p class="indent">He lowered his lantern and turned away along the
running-board, muttering: "Customs, indeed! The
Grand Duchy had better mind its business&mdash;and the
Grand Duchess, too!"</p>

<p class="indent">A few moments later the locomotive whistled a long
signal note to the unseen station.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen," said Guild quietly, "in a few moments I
shall be out of debt to General von Reiter. My life
will be my own to do with as I please. That means
good-bye."</p>

<p class="indent">She said with adorable malice: "I thought you were
going to rob me first."</p>

<p class="indent">"I am," he said, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then I shall make the crime a very difficult one for
you.... So that our&mdash;parting&mdash;may be deferred."</p>

<p class="indent">The train had already come to a standstill beside a
little red-tiled station. Woods surrounded it; nothing
was visible except the lamps on a light station-wagon
drawn up to the right of the track.</p>

<p class="indent">The guard unlocked and opened their compartment.
A young man&mdash;a mere boy&mdash;came up smilingly and
lifted his cap:</p>

<p class="indent">"Mademoiselle Girard? Monsieur Guild? I come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
from Quellenheim with a carriage. I am Fritz Bergner."</p>

<p class="indent">He took their luggage and they followed to the covered
station-wagon. When they were seated the boy
stepped into the front seat, turned his horses, and they
trotted away into the darkness of a forest through
which ran the widely winding road.</p>

<p class="indent">Fresh and aromatic with autumn perfume the unbroken
woods stretched away on either hand beneath the
splendour of the stars. Under little stone bridges
streams darkled, hurrying to the valley; a lake glimmered
through the trees all lustrous in the starlight.</p>

<p class="indent">Something&mdash;perhaps the beauty of the night, possibly
the imminence of his departure, kept them silent
during the drive, until, at last, two unlighted gate-posts
loomed up to the right and the horses swung through
a pair of iron gates and up a driveway full of early
fallen leaves.</p>

<p class="indent">A single light sparkled far at the end of the vista.</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you ever before been here?" asked Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"Once, to a hunt."</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Guild could see the long, two-storied hunting
lodge of timber and stucco construction with its
high peaked roof and dormers and a great pair of
antlers spreading above the hood of the door.</p>

<p class="indent">Out of the doorway came a stout, pleasant-eyed,
brown-skinned woman who curtsied to them smilingly
and welcomed them in German.</p>

<p class="indent">Everything was ready; they had been expected.
There was a fire in the hall and something to eat.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
Guild asked to be driven to an inn, and the housekeeper
seemed surprised. There was no inn. Her orders
were to prepare a room for Herr Guild, who was
expected to remain over night. She regretted that she
could not make them more comfortable, but the Lodge
had been closed all summer, and she had remained alone
with her son Fritzl to care for the place.</p>

<p class="indent">There seemed to be nothing for him to do but to stay
over night.</p>

<p class="indent">Karen, waiting for his decision, looked pale and tired.</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well," he said to Frau Bergner, who curtsied
and went away for their candles. Then he walked over
to where Karen was standing, lifted her hand and
touched the slender fingers with his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good night," she said; "I hope your dreams will
be agreeable."</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope yours will be, also."</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope so. I shall try to continue a dream which I
had on the train. It was an odd one&mdash;something about
a frontier and a sentry box. You woke me before I had
entirely crossed the frontier. I&#39;d like to cross and find
out what really is on the other side."</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed:</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope you will find, there, whatever you desire."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;hope so. Because if I should cross the boundary
and find&mdash;nobody&mdash;there, it might make me unhappy for
the rest of my life." And she looked up at him with a
slight blush on her cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">Then her features grew grave, her eyes serious, clear,
and wistful.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
"I think I am&mdash;learning to care&mdash;a great deal for
you. Don&#39;t let me if I shouldn&#39;t. Tell me while there
is time."</p>

<p class="indent">She turned as the housekeeper came with the lighted
candles.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild stood aside for her to pass, his grave face lowered,
silent before this young girl&#39;s candour and the
troubled sincerity of her avowal.</p>

<p class="indent">In his own room, the lighted candle still in his hand,
he stood motionless, brooding on what she had said.</p>

<p class="indent">And in his heart he knew that, although he had never
liked any woman as much as he liked this young girl,
he was not in love with her. And, somehow or other,
he must tell her so&mdash;while there was still time.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>THE FOREST LISTENS</h3>

<p class="indent">He awoke in a flood of brightest sunshine; his
bed, the floor, the walls, were bathed in it;
netted reflections of water danced and quivered
on the ceiling; and he lay looking at it, pleasantly conscious
of green leaves stirring near his open window
and of the golden splashing of a fountain.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a little bird out there, too, diligently practicing
a few notes. The song was not elaborate. Translated,
it seemed to consist of tweet! tweet! twilly-willy-willy!
repeated an indefinite number of times.</p>

<p class="indent">Curious to discover what his surroundings resembled
he rose and looked out of the curtained window.
There was a grassy carrefour where a fountain spouted
into a stone pool; all else was forest; a stream sparkled
between tree-trunks, bridged where the drive crossed it.</p>

<p class="indent">To bathe and dress did not take him very long. In
the hall, which seemed to be the main living-room below,
he prowled about, examining a number of antlers and
boar-heads mounted on the beamed and plastered walls.
The former had been set up in German fashion, antlers,
brow-antlers, and frontal bone; and these trophies appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
to him uninteresting&mdash;even a trifle ghastly when
the bleached skull also was included.</p>

<p class="indent">The boars&#39; heads were better, nothing extraordinary
in size, but well-tusked. The taxidermy, however, was
wretched.</p>

<p class="indent">The square hall itself did not appear particularly
inviting. The usual long oak table and benches were
there, a number of leather arm-chairs, book-racks, cue-racks,
gun-racks with glazed panes to protect the weapons,
a festoon of spears, hunting knives and curly hunting
horns, skins on the floor, brown bear, wolf, and
stag.</p>

<p class="indent">A badly stuffed otter displayed its teeth on the mantle
over the fireplace between a pair of fighting cock
pheasants and a jar of alcohol containing a large viper,
which embellishments did not add to the cheerfulness
of the place.</p>

<p class="indent">For the rest there was a billiard table shrouded in a
rubber cloth, and three well-engraved portraits on the
walls, Bismarck, after Lehnbach, Frederick the Great
playing on a flute like fury, and the great War Lord
of Europe himself, mustaches on end, sombre-eyed, sullen,
cased in the magnificent steel panoply of the Guard
Cuirassiers. The art gallery bored Guild, and he
opened a door which he suspected communicated with
the pantry.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a valet&#39;s closet and it smelled of camphor.
Shooting-coats hung on stretchers; high-laced shooting-boots
were ranged in rows. On a chair lay Karen&#39;s
skirt and blouse-coat of covert cloth. Both were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
still slightly damp and wrinkled. Evidently they had
been brought down here to be brushed and pressed while
Karen slept.</p>

<p class="indent">Passing his hand over the brown silk lining of the
coat gave him no clue to the hiding-place of the papers;
what revealed their presence was a seam which
had been hurriedly basted with black thread. The keen
point of his pocket-knife released the basting. He drew
out the papers, counted them, identified them one by
one, and placed them in his breast pocket. Then he
laid the coat across the back of the chair again and
went out.</p>

<p class="indent">He had two hours to wait before there could be any
decent hope of breakfast. Nobody seemed to be stirring
in the house. After a few minutes he unlocked the
front door and went out into the early sunshine.</p>

<p class="indent">It was as warm as a spring day; rain had freshened
grass and trees; he sat down on the fountain&#39;s rim and
looked into the pool where a dozen trout lay motionless,
their fins winnowing the icy water.</p>

<p class="indent">No doubt some spring, high on the wooded hills, had
been piped down to furnish the pool with this perpetually
bubbling jet.</p>

<p class="indent">The little bird who had entertained him vocally earlier
in the morning was still vocal somewhere in a huge
beech-tree. Around a spot of moisture on the gravel-drive
two butterflies flitted incessantly. And over all
brooded the calm and exquisite silence of the forest.</p>

<p class="indent">An hour or more later he got up and re-entered the
house.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
First he took a look at the valet&#39;s room. Evidently
Karen&#39;s clothes had been brushed and pressed, for they
had disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">Another door in the square hall promised to lead into
the pantry, judging from significant sounds within.</p>

<p class="indent">It did, and the housekeeper was in there as energetically
busy as every German woman always is when
occupied. And German women are always occupied.</p>

<p class="indent">The kindly soul appeared to be much flattered by his
visit. They had quite a gossiping time of it while she
was preparing the breakfast dishes.</p>

<p class="indent">It was mostly a monologue.</p>

<p class="indent">No, she and Fritzl were not lonely at Quellenheim,
although it was pleasant to have the Lodge open and a
noble company there shooting. But, like Marlbrook,
the Herr Baron had gone to the wars&mdash;alas!&mdash;and it
might take him some time to capture Paris and London
and set the remainder of the world in order.</p>

<p class="indent">But it really seemed too bad; the Herr Baron was
fond of his shooting; Fritzl had reported some good
antlers in the forest, and a grey boar or two&mdash;but enormous!
As for the place it would certainly go to ruin
what with faggot stealers and godless poachers!&mdash;And
the foresters, keepers, and even the wood-choppers all
gone off and deserting the place&mdash;think of it!&mdash;the ungrateful
Kerls&mdash;gone!&mdash;and doubtless to join the crazy
Belgian army which had refused to permit Prussian
troops to pass! <i>Prussian</i> troops! The impudence of
it! Gratitude! There was little of that in the world
it seemed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
"When does the Herr Baron return here?" inquired
Guild, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">It appeared that the Herr Baron was to have arrived
at Quellenheim this very week. But yesterday his adjutant
telegraphed that he could not come perhaps for
many weeks. No doubt he was very busy chasing the
French and English. It was a pity; because the autumn
is <i>wunderschön</i> at Quellenheim. And as for the
deer!&mdash;they stand even in the driveway and look at the
Lodge, doubtless wondering, sir, why they are neglected
by the hunters, and asking one another why good fat
venison is no longer appreciated at Quellenheim.</p>

<p class="indent">"Could you tell me where I may telegraph to the
Herr Baron?" asked the young man, immensely amused
by her gossip.</p>

<p class="indent">"That I can, sir. My careful household reports are
sent to the Herr Baron through military headquarters
at Arenstein, Prussia. That is where he is to be addressed."</p>

<p class="indent">"And a telegraph office?"</p>

<p class="indent">"At the railroad station."</p>

<p class="indent">"In communication with Prussia?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir," she said with a vigorous nod. "And
whenever any of the yokels here about tamper with
the wires the Uhlans come and chase them till they
think the devil is after them!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Uhlans. Here?"</p>

<p class="indent">"And why not? Certainly the Uhlans come occasionally.
They come when it is necessary. Also they
cross the Grand Duchy when they please."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
"Then, if I write out a telegram here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Fritzl will take it, never fear, sir. Leave it on the
billiard table&mdash;any telegrams or letters&mdash;and they shall
be sent when Fritzl drives to the station."</p>

<p class="indent">"Where," he inquired, "is Lesse Forest?" And could
he send a messenger?</p>

<p class="indent">"Lesse Forest? Why the chasse wall separates the
range of the Lesse Hills from Quellenheim. Any peasant
at Trois Fontaines who possesses a bicycle could
take a message and return in an hour."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you know who leases the chasse at Lesse?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. Some wealthy Americans."</p>

<p class="indent">So he smiled his thanks and returned to the hall.
There was writing material on the long oak table.
And first of all he wrote out a brief telegram to
General von Reiter saying that he had fulfilled his
promise.</p>

<p class="indent">This was all he might venture to say in a telegram;
the rest he embodied in his letter to the Herr Baron:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Having telegraphed to you, and fulfilled my
enforced obligations to the letter, I am confident
that you, in your turn, will fulfill yours, release
the hostages held by your troops at Yslemont,
and spare the village any further destruction and
indemnity.</p>

<p class="indent">You had made it a part of the contract that, in
case you were not at Quellenheim, I was to remain
over night under your roof.</p>

<p class="indent">I therefore have done so. It was not an agreeable
sensation, and your forced hospitality, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
will recognize, imposes no obligations upon an
unwilling guest.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, as I say, the last and least item of my indebtedness
to you is finally extinguished, and I
am free once more to do what I choose.</p>

<p class="indent">I shall be a consistent enemy to your country in
whatever capacity the Belgian Government may
see fit to employ me. I shall do your country all
the harm I can. Not being a public executioner
I have given the spies in your employment in
London a week&#39;s grace to clear out before I place
proofs of their identity in the hands of the British
Government.</p>

<p class="indent">This, I believe, closes, for the present, our personal
account.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Girard is well, suffered no particular hardship,
and is, I suppose, quite safe at Quellenheim
where your capable housekeeper and her son are
in charge of the Lodge.</p>

<p class="indent">May I add that, personally, I entertain no animosity
toward you or toward any German, individually&mdash;only
a deep and inextinguishable hatred
toward all that your Empire stands for, and a desire
to aid in the annihilation of this monstrous
anachronism of the twentieth century.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">When he had signed and sealed this, and directed it,
he wrote to his friend Darrel:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Harry</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">If you are at Lesse Forest still, which I understand
adjoins the hills of Quellenheim&mdash;and if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
your friends the Courlands still care to ask me for
a day or two, I shall be very glad to come. I am
at Quellenheim, Trois Fontaines.</p>

<p class="indent">Please destroy the letter I intrusted to you to
send to my mother. Everything is all right again.
I may even have time to fish with you for a day
or two.</p>

<p class="indent">The messenger from Trois Fontaines who takes
this will wait for an answer.</p>

<p class="indent">Please convey my respect and my very lively
sense of obligation to the Courlands. And don&#39;t
let them ask me if it inconveniences them. I can
go to Luxembourg just as well and see you there
if you can run over.</p>

<p class="indent">Did you get my luggage? I am wearing my
last clean shirt. But my clothes are the limit.</p>

<p class="indent">If I am to stop for a day or two at the Courlands
please telegraph to Luxembourg for my luggage
as soon as you receive this.</p>

<p class="right">Yours as usual,<br />
<span class="smcap">Guild</span></p>

<p>P. S.</p>

<p class="indent">Do Uhlans ever annoy the Courlands? I imagine
that Lesse is too far from the railway and too
unimportant from a military standpoint to figure
at all in any operations along the edge of the
Grand Duchy. And also any of the Ardennes is
unfit as a highway between Rhenish Prussia and
France. Am I correct?</p>

<p class="right">G.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">He had sealed and directed this letter, and was gazing
meditatively out of the diamond-leaded windows at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
the splashing fountain in the court, when a slight sound
attracted his attention and he turned, then rose and
stepped forward.</p>

<p class="indent">Karen gave him her hand, smiling. In the other hand
she held the last of her orchids.</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you rested?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. Are you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Perfectly, thank you. Really it is beautiful outside
the house."</p>

<p class="indent">She lifted her lovely eyes and stood gazing out into
the sunshine.</p>

<p class="indent">"There is no word from General von Reiter?" she
asked, absently caressing her cheek with the fragrant
blossom in her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not yet," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"If none comes, what are you going to do?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I am free, anyhow, to leave now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Free?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Free of my engagement with Baron von Reiter."</p>

<p class="indent">"Free of your obligations to&mdash;<i>me</i>?" she asked in a
low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned to her seriously: "My allegiance to you
needs no renewal, Karen, because it has never been
broken. You have my friendship if you wish for it.
It is yours always as long as you care for it."</p>

<p class="indent">"I do.... Are you going to leave&mdash;Quellenheim?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"When?"</p>

<p class="indent">"When a messenger brings me an answer to a letter
which I shall send this morning."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
She stood caressing her lips with his flower and gazing
dreamily into the forest.</p>

<p class="indent">"So you really are going," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">"I cannot help it."</p>

<p class="indent">"I thought"&mdash;she forced a smile&mdash;"that you intended
to rob me first."</p>

<p class="indent">He did not answer.</p>

<p class="indent">"Had you forgotten?" she asked, still with the forced
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you still mean to do it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I told you that I had to have the papers."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, and I told you that I should make it as difficult
as I could for you. And I&#39;m going to. Because I
don&#39;t want you to go." She laughed, then sighed very
frankly: "Of course," she added, "I don&#39;t suppose I
could keep them very long if you have made up your
mind to take them."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is that your idea of me?" he asked, laughing.</p>

<p class="indent">She nodded, thoughtfully: "You take what you
want, sooner or later. There is no hope in opposing
you. You are that kind of man. I have learned
that."</p>

<p class="indent">She touched the orchid to her chin meditatively. "It
surprised me," she added. "I have not been accustomed
to authority like yours. I am my own mistress, and I
supposed I was accountable to myself alone. But&mdash;"
she lifted her eyes, "it appears that I am accountable
to you. And the realization does not seem to anger me
very deeply."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
He looked away: "I do not try to control you, Karen,"
he said in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"You have done so whether or not you have tried. I
don&#39;t know what has happened to me. Do you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing," he said, forcing a laugh. "Except you
are learning that the greatest pleasure of friendship is
a confidence in it which nothing can disturb."</p>

<p class="indent">"Confidence in friendship&mdash;yes. But confidence in
<i>you</i>!&mdash;that ended in our stateroom. Without confidence
I thought friendship impossible.... And here
I am asking you not to go away&mdash;because I&mdash;shall miss
you. Will you tell me what is the matter with a girl
who has no confidence in a man and who desires his companionship
as I do yours?" Her cheeks flushed, but
her eyes were steady, bright, and intelligent: "Am I
going to fall in love with you, Kervyn?"</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed mirthlessly: "No, not if you can reason
with yourself about it," he said. "It merely means that
you are the finest, most honest, most fearless woman I
ever knew, capable of the most splendid friendship, not
afraid to show it. That is all it means, Karen. And I
am deeply, humbly grateful.... And very miserable....
Because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">The entrance of Frau Bergner with the breakfast tray
checked him. They both turned toward the long oak
table.</p>

<p class="indent">Fortunately the culinary school where the housekeeper
had acquired her proficiency was not German.
She had learned her art in Alsace.</p>

<p class="indent">So the coffee was fragrant and the omelette a dream;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
and there were grapes from the kitchen arbour and
ham from a larder never lacking the succulent by-products
of the <i>sanglier</i> of the Ardennes.</p>

<p class="indent">Frau Bergner took his letters and telegram, promising
that Fritzl should find somebody with a bicycle at
Trois Fontaines to carry the other note to Lesse Forest.</p>

<p class="indent">She hovered over them while they ate. The breakfast
was a silent one.</p>

<p class="indent">Afterward Karen wrote a number of notes addressed
to her modiste in Berlin and to various people who
might, in her present emergency, supply her with something
resembling a wardrobe.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild had taken his pipe out to the fountain, where
she could see him through the window, seated on the
coping of the pool, smoking and tracing circles in the
gravel with a broken twig.</p>

<p class="indent">She hurried her notes, called the housekeeper to take
them, then, without taking hat or gloves, she went out
into the sunshine. The habit, so easily acquired, of
being with Guild was becoming a necessity, and neither
to herself nor to him had it yet occurred to her to pretend
anything different.</p>

<p class="indent">There was, in her, an inherent candour, which unqualified,
perhaps unsoftened by coquetry, surprises
more than it attracts a man.</p>

<p class="indent">But its very honesty is its undoing; it fails to hold
the complex masculine mind; its attractiveness is not
permanent. For the average man requires the subtlety
of charm to stir him to sentiment; and charm means
uncertainty; and uncertainty, effort.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
No effortless conquest means more to a man than
friendship. And friendship is nothing new to a man.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was new to Karen; she had opened her mind
to it; she was opening her heart to it, curious concerning
it, interested as she had never before been, sincere
about it&mdash;sincere with herself.</p>

<p class="indent">Never before had the girl cared for a man more than
she had cared about any woman. The women she had
known had not been inferior in intelligence to the men
she knew. And a normal and wholesome mind and heart
harbour little sentiment when the mind is busy and the
body sound.</p>

<p class="indent">But since she had known this man she knew also that
he had appealed to something more than her intelligence.</p>

<p class="indent">Vaguely realizing this in the crisis threatened by his
violence, she had warned him that he was violating something
more than friendship.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the episode had passed and become only an
unquiet memory; but the desire for his companionship
had not passed; it increased, strengthening itself with
every hour in his company, withstanding self-analysis,
self-reproach, defying resentment, mocking her efforts
to stimulate every tradition of pride&mdash;even pride itself.</p>

<p class="indent">Deeply conscious of the power his personality exercised
over her, perplexed, even bewildered at herself,
she had not only endured the intimacy of contact with
him, but in her heart she accepted it, cared for it, was
conscious of relaxation and contentment except for the
constant array of traditional indictments which her conscience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
was busily and automatically finding against
her.</p>

<p class="indent">She could not comprehend why what he had done had
not annihilated her interest in him; why she, even with
effort, could find in her mind no abiding anger, no
scorn, no contempt for him or for what he had done.</p>

<p class="indent">And because she was intelligent and healthy, in her
perplexity she had tried to reason&mdash;had found nothing
to account for her state of mind unless love could
account for it&mdash;and knowing nothing of love, had
admitted the possibility to herself and even to him.
Intelligence, candour, ignorance of deeper emotion&mdash;coupled
with the normal mental and physical innocence
of a young girl&mdash;this was the character she had been
born with and which had naturally and logically developed
through nineteen years of mental and bodily
cultivation. The girl was most fatally equipped for
an awakening.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">He stood up when she appeared, knocked out his
pipe and advanced to meet her. He had been doing a
lot of thinking. And he had concluded to talk very
frankly to her about her friendship with him&mdash;frankly,
kindly, discouraging gaily any mistaken notion she
might harbour that there could be any room, any reason,
any fitness for a deeper sentiment in this friendship&mdash;anything
more significant than the delightful and
frank affection now existing between them.</p>

<p class="indent">"Shall we walk in the forest, Karen?" he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, please."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
So they turned into a sentier which curved away
through a fern-set rabbit warren, over a wooden footbridge,
and then led them on through alternate flecks
of sunshine and shadow through a noble forest of beech
and oak.</p>

<p class="indent">The green and brown mast lay thick under-foot,
premature harvest of windfalls&mdash;perhaps the prodigality
of those reckless sylvan spendthrifts, the squirrels
and jays.</p>

<p class="indent">Here and there a cock-pheasant ran through a spinny
at their approach; rabbits scuttled into wastes of
bracken as yet uncurled and unblemished by a frost; distant
crashes and a dull galloping signalled the unseen
flight of deer. Now and then the dark disturbance of
the forest floor betrayed where the horny, furry snouts
of boar had left furrows of fresh black earth amid the
acorns.</p>

<p class="indent">They came upon the stream again&mdash;or perhaps a
different little brook, splashing and curling amid its
ferns and green, drenched mosses. Stepping stones
crossed it; Karen passed lightly, surely, on little flying
feet, and stood laughing on the other side as he paused
to poke about in the pool in hopes of starting a trout
into arrowy flight.</p>

<p class="indent">When he crossed she had seated herself under a fir,
the branches of which swept the ground around her;
and so utterly had she vanished that she was obliged to
call him before he could discover her whereabouts.</p>

<p class="indent">"Under this green tent," she said, "if I had a bed,
and some books, and clothes, and food, and my maid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
and&mdash;a piano, I could live most happily all summer."
She laughed, looked at him&mdash;"if I had all these and&mdash;<i>you</i>,"
she added.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why drag <i>me</i> into such a perfect paradise?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I shouldn&#39;t <i>drag</i> you," she said gravely. "I should
merely tell you where I lived."</p>

<p class="indent">"I didn&#39;t mean it that way."</p>

<p class="indent">"You might have, with reason. I have demanded a
great deal of your time."</p>

<p class="indent">"I have demanded all of yours!" he retorted, lightly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not more than I was content to give.... It seems
all a dream to me&mdash;which began when you rang the
bell at Hyacinth Villa and roused me from my sleep.
And," she added with a gay flash of malice, "you have
kept me awake ever since."</p>

<p class="indent">"And you, me!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not a bit! You slept in the railway car."</p>

<p class="indent">"So did you."</p>

<p class="indent">"In your arms, practically...." She looked up
at him curiously: "What did you think of me, Kervyn?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I thought you were an exceedingly tired girl."</p>

<p class="indent">"I was. Is that all you thought about it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You know," he said, laughing, "when a man is
asleep he doesn&#39;t do much thinking."</p>

<p class="indent">"What did you think afterward?"</p>

<p class="indent">"About what?"</p>

<p class="indent">"About my sleeping against your shoulder?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing," he said carelessly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Were you quite&mdash;indifferent?"</p>

<p class="indent">He didn&#39;t know how to answer.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
"I was not," she said. "I was contented, and I
thought continually about our friendship&mdash;except when
what I was doing made me uneasy about&mdash;what I was
doing.... Isn&#39;t it curious that a girl could do a thing
like that and feel comfortable except when she remembered
that a girl doesn&#39;t usually do a thing like that?"</p>

<p class="indent">He began to laugh, and she laughed, too.</p>

<p class="indent">She said: "Always my inclination has been, from a
child, to explain things to myself. But I can&#39;t explain
you, yet. You are very different, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not a bit&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, please. I&#39;ve found that out.... Tell me, do
you really mean to go today?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, Karen, I do."</p>

<p class="indent">"Couldn&#39;t you stay?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I really couldn&#39;t."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, please?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I must be about my business."</p>

<p class="indent">"Enlistment?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"In the Guides," she said, as though to herself.</p>

<p class="indent">He nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">"The Guides," she repeated, looking rather vacantly
at a sun spot that waxed and waned on the dry carpet
of fir-needles at her feet. "I have seen them. They are
odd, with their furry headgear and their green jackets
and boots and cherry-red breeches.... I have danced
with officers of the Guides in Brussels.... I never
thought that my first man friend would be an officer in
the Guides."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
"I never thought my best friend among women
would be the first woman I ever robbed," he said rather
grimly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, but you haven&#39;t done it yet! And I don&#39;t see
how you propose to do it."</p>

<p class="indent">He looked up, forcing a smile:</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not if you are going away. How can you? The
only way I can see is for you to stay at Quellenheim in
hopes that I might forget to lock my door some night.
You know," she said, almost wistfully, "I <i>might</i> forget&mdash;if
you remained long enough."</p>

<p class="indent">He shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then you have given it up?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"But I don&#39;t see!"</p>

<p class="indent">She was so pretty in her perplexity, so utterly without
art in her frankness and curiosity that the impulse
to mystify and torment her possessed him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you bet that I shall not have those papers in
my possession within ten minutes?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"How <i>can</i> you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I can. And I shall."</p>

<p class="indent">She gazed at him incredulously, then suddenly her
cheeks lost their colour and she stood up under the
fir-tree.</p>

<p class="indent">"Must I take them or will you give them up, Karen?"
he asked, laughing, as he rose.</p>

<p class="indent">She took a step backward, away from him. The tree-trunk
checked her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
"You know I can&#39;t give them to you," she said unsteadily.
"It would be dishonourable."</p>

<p class="indent">"Am I to take them?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you going to?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you mean to say that rather than surrender
them you would endure such violence as that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I promised.... Are you going to&mdash;to hurt me,
Kervyn?" she stammered.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll try not to."</p>

<p class="indent">She stood there, breathing fast, white, defiant.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;ll have to surrender," he said. "You might as
well. It&#39;s an honourable capitulation in the presence
of superior force."</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"You refuse?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, please."</p>

<p class="indent">He said: "Very well, then," with an alarming frown.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"What?"</p>

<p class="indent">"If you tear my gown I&mdash;I shall have to go to
bed."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m not going to touch your gown," he said. "I&#39;m
going to charm those papers so they&#39;ll leave their hiding
place and fly into my pocket. Watch me very
attentively, Karen!" And he tucked up his cuffs and
made a few short passes in the air. Then he smiled
at her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn! I thought you meant to take them. Do
you know you really did frighten me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I <i>have</i> got them," he said.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
The colour came back into her cheeks; she smiled at
him in a breathless way.</p>

<p class="indent">"You did frighten me," she said. She came slowly
back and seated herself on the carpet of fir-needles. He
sat down beside her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen, dear," he said, "you are a brick and I&#39;m a
brute. I took your papers this morning. I <i>had</i> to,
dear."</p>

<p class="indent">And he drew them from his breast pocket and showed
them to her.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl sat in wide-eyed amazement for a moment.
Suddenly her face flushed and the tears flashed in her
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"You have ridiculed me!" she said. "You have
treated me like a child!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I will not listen! I shall never listen to you again!
You have played with me, hurt me, humiliated me. You
have ruled and overruled me! You gained my friendship
and treated it&mdash;and me&mdash;without ceremony. And
I let you! I must have been mad&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Her mouth quivered; she clenched her hands, gazing
at him through eyes that glimmered wet:</p>

<p class="indent">"How could you do it? I was honest with you; I
had had no experience with a man I cared for. You
knew it. You let me care for you until I didn&#39;t understand&mdash;until
the sincerity and force of what I felt for
you bewildered me!</p>

<p class="indent">"And now&mdash;and now I am&mdash;unhappy&mdash;unhappy&mdash;miserable,
ashamed&mdash;" She caught her breath, scarcely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
able to see him through her tears&mdash;no longer able to
control the quivering lip.</p>

<p class="indent">She rose swiftly, encountered something&mdash;his arm&mdash;felt
herself drawn resistlessly into his embrace.</p>

<p class="indent">"Forgive me, Karen," he said. "I did not realize&mdash;what
was happening to&mdash;us both."</p>

<p class="indent">She rested her forehead on his shoulder for a
moment.</p>

<p class="indent">"Can you forgive me, Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"You know I truly care for you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">Scarcely knowing what he was doing, he bent to
touch her forehead with his lips, and she lifted her face
at the same moment. His kiss fell on her mouth, and
she responded. At the same instant her girlhood ended
forever&mdash;vanished on her lips in a little sigh.</p>

<p class="indent">Dazed, silenced, a trifle faint, she turned from him
blindly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Please," she whispered, in the ghost of a voice; and
he released her.</p>

<p class="indent">For a few moments she stood resting against the
fir-tree, her left arm across her eyes, frightened, motionless.</p>

<p class="indent">The forest was very still around her, as though
every leaf were listening.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>HER FIRST CAMPAIGN</h3>

<p class="indent">"Karen," she heard him say, in a constrained
and unfamiliar voice, "I love you."</p>

<p class="indent">If he thought he was still speaking to the
same girl whose soft and fragrant lips he had touched
a moment before, he was mistaken. He spoke too late.
The girl had vanished with her girlhood.</p>

<p class="indent">And now it was with a very different sort of being
he had to do&mdash;with a woman whose mind had quickened
under shock; whose latent emotions had been made conscious;
whose spirit, awakened by a crisis, was already
armoured and in arms. Aroused, alert, every instinct
awake, proud of a new and radiant knowledge, new
motives germinated, new impulses possessed her; a new
and delicious wisdom thrilled her. She was ready, and
she realized it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">She heard him perfectly. Deep within her something
was laughing. There was no hurry. She knew it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen?" he said, very humbly.</p>

<p class="indent">Conscious of the change within herself, still a little
surprised and excited by it, and by a vaguely exquisite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
sensation of impending adventure, of perils charmingly
indefinite, of the newness of it all, deep, deep within her
she felt the certainty, the tranquillity, the sweet intoxication
of power. Power! She knew she was using
it now. She knew she was exercising it on this man.
And, for a second, the grasp of the new weapon almost
frightened her. For it was her first campaign. And
she had not yet reconnoitered the adversary or fully
developed his strength and position. Man, as an adversary,
was still unknown to her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen?" he ventured, rather anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">Instantly she lost a large portion of her fear of him.
Oh! but she had a long, long reckoning to settle yet
with him. She cast a swift glance backward, but already
her girlhood was gone&mdash;gone with its simplicity, its
quaint perplexities, its dear ignorance, its pathos, its
helplessness before experience, its naïveté, its faith.</p>

<p class="indent">It had gone, slipped away, exhaled in a deep, unconscious
sigh. And suddenly she flushed hotly, remembering
his lips. Truly, truly there was a long reckoning
still to come.... But there seemed to be no hurry.</p>

<p class="indent">Still leaning against the tree, she fumbled for her
handkerchief, touched her eyes with it leisurely, then,
still turning her back to him, she lifted her hands to
her hair.</p>

<p class="indent">For a first campaign she was doing very well.</p>

<p class="indent">Her thick, burnished hair was not in any desperate
disorder, but she touched it here and there, patted,
tucked, caressed it with light, swift fingers, delicately
precise as the exploring antennæ of a butterfly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
"Give me my answer, Karen," he urged, in a low
voice, stepping nearer. Instantly she moved lightly
aside to avoid him&mdash;just a short step&mdash;her back still
turned, her hands framing her bright hair. Presently
she looked around with a slight laugh, which seemed
to say: "Have you noticed my new wings? If I choose
to use them, I become unattainable. Take care, my
friend!"</p>

<p class="indent">The expression of her face checked him; her eyes
were still starry from tears. The dewy loveliness of
them, the soft shyness born of knowledge, the new
charm of her left him silent and surprised. He had
supposed that she was rather low in her mind. Also he
became aware that something about her familiar to him
had gone, that he was confronted by something in her
hitherto unsuspected and undetected&mdash;something subtly
experienced and unexpectedly mature. But that
a new intelligence, made radiant by the consciousness
of power, had suddenly developed and enveloped this
young girl, and was now confronting him he did not
comprehend at first.</p>

<p class="indent">And yet, in her attitude, in the poise of the small
head, in the slight laugh parting her lips, in every line
of her supple figure, every contour, every movement,
he was aware of a surety, a self-confidence, a sort of
serene authority utterly unfamiliar to him in her personality.</p>

<p class="indent">Gone was the wistfulness, the simplicity, the indecision
of immaturity, the almost primitive candour
that knows no art. Here was complexity looking out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
of eyes he scarcely knew, baffling him with a beauty
indescribable.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen&mdash;dear?" he said unsteadily, "have you nothing
to say to me?"</p>

<p class="indent">There was laughter and curiosity in her eyes, and a
hint of mockery.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," she said, "I have a great deal to say to you.
In the first place we must not be silly any more&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Silly!</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">She seemed surprised at his emphatic interruption.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, silly," she repeated serenely; "foolish, inconsequential.
I admit I made a goose of myself, but that
is no excuse for you to do it, too. You are older and
more experienced and <i>so</i> much wiser&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes?" she said innocently.</p>

<p class="indent">"What has happened to you?" he asked, disturbed
and bewildered.</p>

<p class="indent">She opened her eyes at that:</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing has happened, has it? Is my gown torn?"&mdash;bending
over to survey her skirt and waist&mdash;"Oh, I
forgot that the famous robbery occurred without
violence&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He reddened: "I don&#39;t understand you, Karen. Why
do you fence this way with me? Why do you speak this
way to me? What has suddenly changed you&mdash;totally
altered you&mdash;altered your attitude toward me, your
point of view, your disposition&mdash;your very character
apparently&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"My character?" she repeated with a gay little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
laugh which seemed to him irresponsible, and confused
him exceedingly.</p>

<p class="indent">"No," he said, troubled, "that couldn&#39;t change so
suddenly. But I never before saw this side of your
character. I didn&#39;t know it existed&mdash;never supposed&mdash;dreamed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Speaking of dreams," she interrupted with calm
irrelevance, "I never told you that I finally did cross
that frontier. Shall I tell you about it while we are
walking back?"</p>

<p class="indent">"If you choose," he said, almost sullenly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t you care to hear about my dream? As I
made a pillow of you during the process, I really think
you are entitled to hear about it&mdash;" She broke off
with a quick, involuntary laugh: "Why do you look
hurt, Kervyn?"</p>

<p class="indent">At that he became serious to the verge of gloom.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come," she said sweetly, slipping her hand through
his arm, "I want to tell you how I crossed that wonderful
frontier&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I told you," he said gravely, "that I love you. Am
I not entitled to an answer?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Entitled, Kervyn? I don&#39;t know to how many
things you are <i>en</i>-titled. All I know is that you are
titled&mdash;several times&mdash;aren&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">He reddened and bit his lip.</p>

<p class="indent">"Because," she went on gaily, "you served your time
in the Guides. That is a very natural deduction, isn&#39;t it?"</p>

<p class="indent">He said nothing; he was very seriously upset. His
stern mouth and darkened face betrayed it. And deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
in Karen&#39;s heart the little imps of laughter danced to its
mischievous beating.</p>

<p class="indent">After they had walked through the forest for a while
in silence, she halted and withdrew her arm.</p>

<p class="indent">"You know," she said, "we are not nearly well enough
acquainted for you to be moody and unamiable."</p>

<p class="indent">"I did not mean to be either," he said. "What is it
that has come between us, Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, nothing I hope," she said fervently.</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope so, too.... You have been different
since&mdash;" He hesitated, and she turned her head carelessly
and looked back at the little brook they had
crossed. When her blush had cooled she resumed her
leisurely walk and glanced up at him inquiringly:</p>

<p class="indent">"Since <i>when</i> have you thought me different?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Since we&mdash;<i>kissed</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Please, Kervyn! Not <i>we</i>. I think it was you who
performed that very childish rite."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is that the way you regarded it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Didn&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"You didn&#39;t take it seriously!" she exclaimed with an
enchanting laugh. "Did you really? I&#39;m so dreadfully
sorry!"</p>

<p class="indent">The dark flush on his face frightened her. It was
her first campaign and she was easily alarmed. But
she was wise enough to say nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," he said with an effort, "I did take it very
seriously. And I took you seriously, too. I don&#39;t understand
your new attitude toward me&mdash;toward life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
itself. Until today I had never seen any lightness in
you, any mockery&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Lightness? You saw plenty in me. I was not very
difficult, was I?&mdash;on the train? Not very reticent about
my views concerning friendship and my fears concerning&mdash;love.
Why should you be surprised at the frivolity
of such a girl? It has taken so many years for me
to learn to laugh. Nineteen, I think. Won&#39;t you let
me laugh a little, now that I know how?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Have I any influence at all with you?" he asked.
"I thought I had."</p>

<p class="indent">"I thought so, too," she mused, innocently.</p>

<p class="indent">"What has happened to destroy it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, nothing, Kervyn!" opening her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"Does any of my influence with you remain?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Loads of it. Oceans! Bushels!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you care for me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course! The silly question."</p>

<p class="indent">"Seriously?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, but I don&#39;t wish to weep because I care for
you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Could you learn to love me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Learn? I don&#39;t know," she mused aloud, apparently
much interested in the novelty of the suggestion.
"I learn some things easily; mathematics I never could
learn. <i>Why</i> are you scowling, Kervyn?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Could you ever love me?" he persisted, doggedly.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know. Do you desire to pay your court
to me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;yes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
"You appear to be uncertain. It seems to me that a
man ought to know whether or not he desires to pay
his addresses to a girl."</p>

<p class="indent">"Can&#39;t you be serious, Karen!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Indeed I can. You ought to know it, too. I was
serious enough over you, once. I followed you about
so faithfully and persistently that even when you took
a nap I did it too&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen, do you love me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know."</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you try?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m always willing to try anything&mdash;once."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then suppose you try marrying me, once!" he said,
bluntly.</p>

<p class="indent">"But oughtn&#39;t a girl to be in love before she tries
that? Besides, before I am quite free to converse with
you on that subject I must converse with someone else."</p>

<p class="indent">"What!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Had you forgotten?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you mean the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," she said hastily&mdash;"you <i>do</i> remember. <i>That</i>
is a prior engagement."</p>

<p class="indent">"Engagement!"</p>

<p class="indent">"An engagement to converse on the subject of engagements.
I told you about it&mdash;in the days of my
communicative innocence."</p>

<p class="indent">He was patient because he had to be.</p>

<p class="indent">"After you have made your answer clear to him, may
I ask you again?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ask me what?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
"To marry me."</p>

<p class="indent">"Wouldn&#39;t that permission depend upon what answer
I may give <i>him</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Good Heavens!" he exclaimed, "is there any doubt
about your answer to him?"</p>

<p class="indent">She lifted her eyebrows: "You are entirely too confident.
Must I first ask your permission to fulfill my obligations
and then accomplish them in a manner that suits
your views? It sounds a little like dictation, Kervyn."</p>

<p class="indent">He walked beside her, cogitating in gloom and
silence. Was this the girl he had known? Was this
the same ungrateful and capricious creature upon
whom he had bestowed his protection, his personal interest,
his anxious thoughts?</p>

<p class="indent">That he had fallen in love with her had surprised
him, but it did not apparently surprise her. Had she
instinctively foreseen what was going to happen to him?
Had she deliberately watched the process with wise and
feminine curiosity, coolly keeping her own skirts clear?</p>

<p class="indent">And the more he cogitated, the deeper and more complex
appeared to him her intuitive and merciless knowledge
of man.</p>

<p class="indent">Never had he beheld such lightning change in a
woman. It couldn&#39;t be a change; all this calm self-possession,
all the cool badinage, all this gaiety, this
laughing malice, this serene capacity for appraising
man and his motives must have existed in her&mdash;hidden,
not latent; concealed, not embryotic!</p>

<p class="indent">He was illogical and perfectly masculine.</p>

<p class="indent">She was only a young girl, awakened, and making
her first campaign.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>LESSE FOREST</h3>

<p class="indent">As they came out of the forest and crossed the
grassy circle where the fountain was splashing
they saw an automobile standing in the drive
by the front door.</p>

<p class="indent">"What does that mean?" exclaimed Guild, under his
breath.</p>

<p class="indent">Both had halted, checked by the same impulse.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it likely to be Baron von Reiter?" he asked,
coldly.</p>

<p class="indent">She said, with admirable composure: "Whoever it is,
we shall have to go in."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, of course.... But if it happens to be the
Baron&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well?" she asked, looking away from him.</p>

<p class="indent">"In that event, have you nothing to say to me&mdash;<i>now</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Haven&#39;t you, Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head, gazing steadily away from him.</p>

<p class="indent">"All right," he said, controlling his voice; "then I
can make my adieux to you indoors as well as here."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
"Are you leaving immediately?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. I should have left this morning."</p>

<p class="indent">After a moment&#39;s silence: "Shall I hear from you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Have I your permission to write&mdash;if I can do
so?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know yet. I shall write you first. Are you
to be at Lesse Forest for a few days?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. A note will reach me in care of Mrs. Courland."</p>

<p class="indent">Her pretty head was still averted. "We ought to
go in now," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild glanced sharply at the car as they passed it,
and the chauffeur touched his cap to them. It was a
big, dark blue, three-seated touring car, and there
seemed to be nothing at all military in its appointments
or in the chauffeur&#39;s livery.</p>

<p class="indent">He opened the front door for Karen, and they walked
into the hall together.</p>

<p class="indent">A man rose quickly from a leather chair, as though
he were a little lame. "Hello, Kervyn!" he said gaily,
advancing with hand extended. "How are you, old
top!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Harry!" exclaimed Guild; "I&#39;m terribly glad to see
you!"</p>

<p class="indent">They stood for a moment smiling at each other, hand
clasped in hand. Then Darrel said:</p>

<p class="indent">"When your note came this morning, we decided to
motor over, Miss Courland and I&mdash;" He turned
toward a brown-eyed, blond young girl: "Valentine,
this is the celebrated vanishing man I&#39;ve been worrying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
over so long. You may not think he is worth worrying
over, now that you see him, and maybe he isn&#39;t; but
somehow or other I like him."</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Courland laughed. "I think I shall like him,
too," she said, "now that I know he isn&#39;t merely a figment
of your imagination&mdash;" She turned her brown
eyes, pleasantly and a trifle curiously, toward Karen,
who had paused beside the long table&mdash;a lithe and
graceful figure in silhouette against the brilliancy of
the sun-lit doorway.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen," said Guild, "this is Miss Courland who
extends her own and Mrs. Courland&#39;s charity to me&mdash;"
He checked himself, smiling. "<i>Do</i> you still extend it,
Miss Courland?"</p>

<p class="indent">Valentine had come forward and had offered her hand
to Karen, and retaining it for a second, she turned to
answer Guild:</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course! We came to take you back with us."
And, to Karen: "It isn&#39;t a very gracious thing for us
to do&mdash;to steal a guest from Quellenheim&mdash;and I am
afraid you do not feel very grateful toward me for
doing it."</p>

<p class="indent">Their hands parted and their eyes rested on each
other for a second&#39;s swift feminine appraisal.</p>

<p class="indent">"Baron von Reiter has not yet arrived," said Karen,
"so I do not think Mr. Guild has had a very interesting
visit. I feel as though I ought to thank you for asking
him to Lesse."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild, who was talking to Darrel, heard her, and
gave her a rather grim look.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
Then he presented Darrel; and the light, gossipy
conversation became general.</p>

<p class="indent">With one ear on duty and one listening to Darrel,
Guild heard Karen giving to Valentine a carelessly
humorous outline of her journey from England&mdash;caught
the little exclamations of interest and sympathy
from the pretty brown-eyed American girl, and still
was able to sketch for Darrel the same theme from his
own more sober point of view.</p>

<p class="indent">Neither he nor Karen, of course, spoke of the reason
for Guild&#39;s going to England, nor that the journey
had been undertaken on compulsion, nor, indeed, did
they hint at anything concerning the more sinister and
personal side of the affair. It merely appeared that a
German general, presumably a friend of Guild, not
being able to get his daughter out of England after
hostilities had commenced, had confided the task to a
man he trusted and who was able to go unquestioned
into a country at war with his own. But it all seemed
quite romantic enough, even under such circumstances,
to thrill Valentine Courland.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do come back to Lesse with us, won&#39;t you?" she
asked Karen. "My mother and I would love to have
you. You&#39;d be bored to distraction here with only the
housekeeper. Do come!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I haven&#39;t any clothes," said Karen frankly.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have loads of them! We&#39;d be so glad to have
you at Lesse. Won&#39;t you come back with us?"</p>

<p class="indent">Karen laughed, enchanted. She could see Guild without
looking at him. His attitude was eloquent.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
"If you really do want me, I&#39;ll come," she said. "But
you and Mr. Darrel will remain to luncheon, won&#39;t you?
I&#39;ll speak to the Frau Förster&mdash;if I may be excused&mdash;"
She fell for a moment again, unconsciously, into her
quaint schoolgirl manner, and dropped them a little
curtsey.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild opened the pantry door for her and held it.</p>

<p class="indent">"May I explain to them a little more clearly who you
are, Karen?" he asked in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, please."</p>

<p class="indent">He came back into the hall where Miss Courland and
Darrel were talking. Valentine turned swiftly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Isn&#39;t she the sweetest thing!" exclaimed the girl
warmly.</p>

<p class="indent">"She is really very wonderful," said Guild; "let me
tell you a little about her accomplishments and herself."</p>

<p class="indent">They were still listening to Guild, with an interest
which absorbed them, when Karen returned.</p>

<p class="indent">"The few clothes I have," she said, "are being repacked
by Frau Bergner. Kervyn, shall she repack
your sack?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I&#39;ll do that," he said, turning away with the
happiest face he had worn that morning. And the girl
knew that it was because they were going away together
again&mdash;taking life&#39;s highway once more in each other&#39;s
company. Involuntarily she looked after him, conscious
for a second, again, of new and powerful motives,
new currents, new emotions invading her; and she wondered
how vitally they concerned this man who had so
suddenly destroyed a familiar world for her and as suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
was offering her as substitute a new and strange
one.</p>

<p class="indent">Emerging from her brief abstraction she looked
across the hall at Valentine Courland, who, seated on
the oak table, chatted animatedly with Darrel. The
girl was exceedingly attractive; Karen realized that at
once. Also this pretty American had said very frankly
that she was certain to like Guild. Karen had heard
her say it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Miss Girard," said Darrel, "is the shooting good
at Quellenheim? I imagine it must be, judging from
these trophies." He waved a comprehensive hand toward
the walls of the room.</p>

<p class="indent">Karen came slowly over to Valentine: "I really don&#39;t
know much about shooting. There are boar and deer
here. I suppose at Lesse Forest you have really excellent
sport, don&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Our guests seem to find the shooting good," replied
Valentine. "My mother and I go out with them sometimes.
I don&#39;t know whether we shall be able to offer
anybody any shooting this autumn. We are exceedingly
worried about Lesse Forest. You see, every autumn
we renew the lease, but our lease expired last
week, and we can&#39;t renew it because nobody seems to
know where our landlord is or where to find him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is your landlord Belgian?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. He is a wealthy brewer at Wiltz-la-Vallée.
And the Germans bombarded and burnt it&mdash;everything
is in ruins and the people fled or dead. So we are really
very much concerned about the possible fate of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
landlord, Monsieur Paillard, and we don&#39;t exactly know
what to do."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild returned, coming downstairs two at a time, his
attractive features very youthful and animated. And
Karen, discreetly observing him and his buoyant demeanour,
felt a swift and delightful confusion in the
knowledge of her power to make or unmake the happiness
of a grown man.</p>

<p class="indent">Frau Bergner appeared with cloth and covers, beaming,
curtseying to all; and very soon they were at
luncheon&mdash;a simple but perfectly cooked luncheon,
where everything was delectable and there did not seem
to be very much of any particular variety, yet there
was just a trifle more than enough for everybody.
Which is the real triumph of a good German, French,
or Belgian housekeeper&#39;s calculations.</p>

<p class="indent">And when luncheon was ended the luggage already
had been placed in the car; the chauffeur emerged from
the kitchen where Frau Bergner had been generous to
him; and in a few moments the big blue machine was
whirring smoothly on its way to Lesse, through the
beautiful Ardennes forests over smooth, well-cared-for
roads, the sun shining in a cloudless sky, and four
young people making rapid headway in a new acquaintanceship
which seemed to promise everything
agreeable and gay.</p>

<p class="indent">At the huge, moss-grown gate-posts of Lesse a forester
lifted his grey felt hat and opened the gates; and
around the first curve appeared the celebrated and
beautiful old lodge of weather-stained stone and slate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
the narrow terrace blazing with geraniums and scarlet
sage.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild noticed a slender, red-haired girl seated on the
steps, knitting, with a heap of dark-blue wool in her
lap; but when the car drew up, Valentine Courland addressed
her as "mother"&mdash;to the intense surprise of
Karen as well as of himself, for Mrs. Courland seemed
scarce older than her own daughter, and quite as
youthfully attractive.</p>

<p class="indent">She welcomed Karen with a sweet directness of manner
which won the girl instantly; and her manner to
Guild was no less charming&mdash;an older woman&#39;s delightful
recognition of a young man&#39;s admiration, and a
smiling concession to this young man&#39;s youth and good
looks.</p>

<p class="indent">When Valentine mentioned Karen&#39;s plight in the matter
of wardrobe, her mother laughed gaily and, slipping
one arm around Karen&#39;s waist, took her off into
the house.</p>

<p class="indent">"We shall remedy that immediately," she said.
"Come and see what suits you best."</p>

<p class="indent">"As for you," said Darrel to Guild, "your luggage
is in your room. I suppose you are glad of that."</p>

<p class="indent">"Rather," said Guild with such intense feeling that
Valentine Courland laughed outright.</p>

<p class="indent">"Take him to his beloved luggage," she said to Darrel;
"I had no idea he was so vain. You know the
room, don&#39;t you? It is next to your own."</p>

<p class="indent">"Harry, why are you limping?" asked Valentine as
Darrel rose to go.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
"I&#39;m not."</p>

<p class="indent">"You are. Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Rum. I drink too much of it," he explained seriously.</p>

<p class="indent">So the young men went away together; and presently
Guild was flinging from him the same worn clothing
which, at one terrible moment, seemed destined to become
his shroud: and Darrel sat on the bed and gave
him an outline of the life at Lesse Forest and of the
two American women who lived there.</p>

<p class="indent">"Courland loved the place," said Darrel, "and for
many years until his death he spent the summers here
with his wife and daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">"That&#39;s why they continue to come. The place is part
of their life. But I don&#39;t know what they&#39;ll do now.
Monsieur Paillard, their landlord, hasn&#39;t been heard of
since the Germans bombarded and burnt Wiltz-la-Vallée.
Whether poor Paillard got knocked on the
head by a rifle-butt or a 41-centimetre shell, or whether
he was lined up against some garden wall with the other
poor devils when the Prussian firing-squads sickened
and they had to turn the machine-guns on the prisoners,
nobody seems to know.</p>

<p class="indent">"Wiltz-la-Vallée is nothing but an ill-smelling heap of
rubbish. The whole country is in a horrible condition.
You know a rotting cabbage or beet or turnip field
emits a bad enough smell. Add to that the stench from
an entire dead and decomposing community of three
thousand people! Oh yes, they dug offal trenches, but
they weren&#39;t deep enough. And besides there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
enough else lying dead under the blackened bricks and
rafters to poison the atmosphere of a whole country.
It&#39;s a ghastly thing what they&#39;ve done to Belgium!"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild went to his modern bathroom to bathe, but
left the door open.</p>

<p class="indent">"Go on, Harry," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, that&#39;s about all," continued Darrel. "The
Germans left death and filth behind them. Not only
what the hands of man erected is in ruins, but the very
face of the earth itself is mangled out of all recognition.
They tore Nature herself to pieces, stamped her
features out, obliterated her very body! You ought
to see some of the country! I don&#39;t mean where towns
or solitary farms were. I mean the <i>land</i>, the <i>landscape</i>!&mdash;all
full of slimy pits from their shells, cut in every
direction by their noisome trenches, miles and miles of
roadside trees shot to splinters, woodlands burnt to
ashes, forests torn to slivers&mdash;one vast, distorted and
abominable desolation."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild had reappeared, and was dressing.</p>

<p class="indent">"They didn&#39;t ransack the Grand Duchy," continued
Darrel, "although I heard that the Grand Duchess
blocked their road with her own automobile and faced
the invaders until they pushed her aside with scant ceremony.
If she did that she&#39;s as plucky as she is pretty.
That&#39;s the story, anyway."</p>

<p class="indent">"Have the Germans bothered you here?" asked Guild,
buttoning a fresh collar.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not any to speak of. Of course they don&#39;t care
anything about the frontier; they&#39;d violate it in a minute.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
And I&#39;ve been rather worried because a lot of
these Luxembourg peasants, particularly the woodsmen
and forest dwellers, are Belgians, or are in full sympathy
with them. And I&#39;m afraid they&#39;ll do something
that will bring the Germans to Lesse Forest."</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean some sort of franc-tireur business?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I mean just that."</p>

<p class="indent">"The Germans shoot franc-tireurs without court-martial."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know it. And there has been sniping across the
border, everywhere, even since the destruction of Wiltz-la-Vallée.
I expect there&#39;ll be mischief here sooner or
later."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild, tall, broad-shouldered, erect, stood by the window
looking out between the gently blowing sash-curtains,
and fastening his waistcoat.</p>

<p class="indent">And, standing so, he said: "Harry, this is no place
for Mrs. Courland and her daughter. They ought to
go to Luxembourg City, or across the line into Holland.
As a matter of fact they really ought to go back to
America."</p>

<p class="indent">"I think so too," nodded Darrell. "I think we may
persuade them to come back with us."</p>

<p class="indent">Without looking at his business partner and friend,
Guild said: "I am not going back with you."</p>

<p class="indent">"What!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t. But you must go&mdash;rather soon, too. And
you must try to persuade the Courlands to go with
you."</p>

<p class="indent">"What are you planning to do?" demanded Darrel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
with the irritable impatience of a man who already has
answered his own question.</p>

<p class="indent">"You can guess, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, dammit!&mdash;I can! I&#39;ve been afraid you&#39;d do
some such fool thing. And I ask you, Kervyn, as a
sane, sensible Yankee business man, <i>is</i> it necessary for
you to gallop into this miserable free fight and wallow
in it up to your neck? Is it? Is it necessary to propitiate
your bally ancestors by pulling a gun on the
Kaiser and striking an attitude?"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild laughed. "I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s a matter of propitiating
my own conscience, Harry. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll
have to strike an attitude and pull that gun."</p>

<p class="indent">"To the glory of the Gold Book and the Counts of
Gueldres! <i>I</i> know! You&#39;re very quiet about such
things, but I knew it was inside you all the time. Confound
it! I was that worried by your letter to me! I
thought you&#39;d already done something and had been
caught."</p>

<p class="indent">"I hadn&#39;t been doing anything, but I <i>had</i> been
caught."</p>

<p class="indent">"I knew it!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Naturally; or I shouldn&#39;t have written you a one-act
melodrama instead of a letter.... Did you destroy
the letter to my mother?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I did."</p>

<p class="indent">"That was right. I&#39;ll tell you about it some time.
And now, before we go down, this is for your own instruction:
I am going to try to get into touch with the
Belgian army. How to do it I don&#39;t see very clearly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
because there are some two million Germans between
me and it. But that&#39;s what I shall try to do, Harry.
So, during the day or two I remain here, persuade
your friends, the Courlands, of the very real danger
they run in remaining at Lesse. Because any of these
peasants at any moment are likely to sally forth
Uhlan sniping. And you know what German reprisals
mean."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," said Darrel uneasily. He added with a boyish
blush: "I&#39;m rather frightfully fond of Valentine
Courland, too."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then talk to the Courlands. Something serious evidently
has happened to their landlord. If he made
himself personally obnoxious to the soldiery which
destroyed Wiltz-la-Vallée, a detachment might be sent
here anyway to destroy Lesse Lodge. You can&#39;t tell
what the Teutonic military mind is hatching. I was
playing chess when they were arranging a shooting
party in my honour. Come on downstairs."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, in a minute. Kervyn, I don&#39;t believe you quite
got me&mdash;about Valentine Courland."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild looked around at him curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it the real thing, Harry?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Rather. With <i>me</i>, I mean."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re in <i>love</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Rather! But Valentine raises the deuce with me.
She won&#39;t listen, Kervyn. She sits on sentiment. She
guys me. I don&#39;t think she likes anybody else, but I&#39;m
dead sure she doesn&#39;t care for me&mdash;that way."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild studied the pattern on the rug at his feet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
After a while he said: "When a man&#39;s in love he doesn&#39;t
seem to know it until it&#39;s too late."</p>

<p class="indent">"Rot! I knew it right away. Last winter when the
Courlands were in New York I knew I was falling in
love with her. It hurt, too, I can tell you. Why,
Kervyn, after they sailed it hurt me so that I couldn&#39;t
think of anything. I didn&#39;t eat properly. A man like
you can&#39;t realize how it hurts to love a girl. But it&#39;s
one incessant, omnipresent, and devilish gnawing&mdash;a
sensation of emptiness indescribable filled with loud and
irregular heart-throbs&mdash;a happy agony, a precious
pain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Harry!"</p>

<p class="indent">"What?" asked that young man, startled.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you realize you are almost shouting?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Was I? Well, I&#39;m almost totally unbalanced and
I don&#39;t know how long I can stand the treatment I&#39;m
getting. I&#39;ve told her mother, and she laughs at me,
too. But I honestly think she likes me. What would
you do, Kervyn, if you cared for a girl and you couldn&#39;t
induce her to converse on the subject?"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild&#39;s features grew flushed and sombre. "I haven&#39;t
the faintest idea what a man should do," he said.
"The dignified thing would be for a man to drop the
matter."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know. I&#39;ve dropped it a hundred times a week.
But she seems to be glad of it. And I can&#39;t endure that.
So I re-open the subject, and she re-closes it and sits on
the lid. I tell you, Kervyn, it&#39;s amounting to a living
nightmare with me. I am so filled with tenderness and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
sentiment that I can&#39;t digest it unaided by the milk of
human kindness&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you talk this way to her?" asked Guild,
laughing. "If you compare unrequited love to
acute indigestion no girl on earth is going to listen
to you."</p>

<p class="indent">"I have to use some flights of imagination," said
Darrel, sulkily. "A girl likes to hear anything when
it&#39;s all dolled out with figures of speech. What the
deuce are you laughing at? All right! Wait until you
fall in love yourself. But you won&#39;t have time now;
you&#39;ll enlist in some fool regiment and get your bally
head knocked off! I thought I had troubles enough
with Valentine, and now this business begins!"</p>

<p class="indent">He got up slowly, as though very lame.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s very terrible to me," he said, "to know that you
feel bound to go into this mix-up. I was afraid of it
as soon as I heard that war had been declared. It&#39;s been
worrying me every minute since. But I suppose it&#39;s
quite useless to argue with you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Quite," said Guild pleasantly. "What&#39;s the matter
with your leg?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Barked the shin. Listen! Is there any use reasoning
with you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, Harry."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, then," exclaimed Darrel in an irate voice, "I&#39;ll
tell you frankly that you and your noble ancestors give
me a horrible pain! I&#39;m full of all kinds of pain and
I&#39;m sick of it!"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild threw back his blond head and laughed out-right&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
clear, untroubled laugh that rang pleasantly
through the ancient hall they were traversing.</p>

<p class="indent">As they came out on the terrace where the ladies
sat in the sun knitting, Valentine looked around at
Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"What a delightfully infectious laugh you have," she
said. "Was it a very funny story? I can scarcely believe
Mr. Darrel told it."</p>

<p class="indent">"But he did," said Guild, seating himself beside her
on the edge of the stone terrace and glancing curiously
at Karen, who wore a light gown and was looking distractingly
pretty.</p>

<p class="indent">"Such an unpleasant thing has occurred," said Mrs.
Courland in her quiet, gentle voice, turning to Darrel.
"Our herdsman has just come in to tell Michaud that
early this morning a body of German cavalry rode into
the hill pastures and drove off the entire herd of cattle
and the flock of sheep belonging to Monsieur Paillard."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a moment&#39;s silence; Darrel glanced at
Guild, saying: "Was there any explanation offered for
the requisition?&mdash;any indemnity?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing, apparently. Schultz, the herdsman, told
Michaud that an Uhlan officer asked him if the cattle
and sheep did not belong to the Paillard estate at Lesse.
That was all. And the shepherd, Jean Pascal, tried to
argue with the troopers about his sheep, but a cavalryman
menaced him with his lance. The poor fellow is
out in the winter fold, weeping like Bo-Peep, and
Schultz is using very excited language. All our forest
guards and wood-choppers are there. Michaud has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
gone to Trois Fontaines. They all seem so excited that
it has begun to disturb me a little."</p>

<p class="indent">"You see," said Valentine to Guild, "our hill pastures
are almost on the frontier. We have been afraid they&#39;d
take our cattle."</p>

<p class="indent">He nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you suppose anything can be done about it?"
asked Mrs. Courland. "I feel dreadfully that such a
thing should happen at Lesse while we are in occupation."</p>

<p class="indent">"May I talk with your head gamekeeper?" asked
Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, indeed, if you will. He ought to return from
Trois Fontaines before dark."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll talk to him," said Guild briefly. Then his
serious face cleared and he assumed a cheerfulness of
manner totally at variance with his own secret convictions.</p>

<p class="indent">"Troops have got to eat," he said. "They&#39;re likely
to do this sort of thing. But the policy of the Germans,
when they make requisition for anything, seems to be
to pay for it with vouchers of one sort or another.
They are not robbers when unmolested, but they are
devils when interfered with. Most troops are."</p>

<p class="indent">The conversation became general; Darrel, sitting between
Karen and Mrs. Courland, became exceedingly
entertaining, to judge from Karen&#39;s quick laughter and
the more subdued amusement of Katharyn Courland.</p>

<p class="indent">Darrel was explaining his lameness.</p>

<p class="indent">But the trouble with Darrel was that his modesty inclined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
him to be humorous at his own expense. Few
women care for unattractive modesty; few endure it,
none adores it. He was too modest to be attractive.</p>

<p class="indent">"I was sauntering along," he said, "minding my own
business, when I came face to face with a wild boar. He
was grey, and he was far bigger than I ever again desire
to see. Before I could recover my breath his eyes
got red and he began to make castanette music with his
tusks, fox-trot time. And do you know what happened&mdash;in
<i>your</i> forest, Mrs. Courland? I went up a tree, and
I barked my shin in doing it. If you call that hospitality,
my notions on the subject are all wrong."</p>

<p class="indent">"Didn&#39;t you have a gun?" asked Karen.</p>

<p class="indent">"I did. I admit it without a blush."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why didn&#39;t you use it?" asked Mrs. Courland.</p>

<p class="indent">"Use it? How? A gun doesn&#39;t help a man to climb
a tree. It is in the way. I shall carry no more guns
in your forest. A light extension ladder is all I require.
And a book to pass away the time when treed."</p>

<p class="indent">They all laughed. "Really," asked Guild curiously,
"why didn&#39;t you shoot?"</p>

<p class="indent">"First of all," said Darrel serenely, "I do not know
how to fire off a gun. Do you want any further reasons?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You looked so picturesque," said Valentine scornfully,
"I never dreamed you were such a dub! And you
don&#39;t seem to care, either."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t. I like to catch little fish. But my ferocity
ends there. Kervyn, shall we try the trout for an hour
this afternoon?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
Valentine turned up her dainty nose. "I shall take
Mr. Guild myself. You&#39;d better find a gamekeeper
who&#39;ll teach you how to shoot off a gun." And, to
Guild: "I&#39;ll take you now if you like. It&#39;s only a little
way to the Silverwiltz. Shall I get a rod and fly-book
for you?"</p>

<p class="indent">Karen, watching her, saw the frank challenge in her
pretty brown eyes, saw Guild&#39;s swift response to that
gay defiance. It was only the light, irresponsible encounter
of two young people who had liked each other
at sight and who had already established a frank understanding.</p>

<p class="indent">So Valentine went into the house and returned presently
switching a light fly-rod and a cast of flies; and
Guild walked over and joined her.</p>

<p class="indent">To Karen he looked very tall and sunburned, and unfamiliar
in his blue-serge lounging clothes&mdash;very perfectly
groomed, very severe, and unapproachable; and
so much older, so much more mature, so much wiser
than she had thought him.</p>

<p class="indent">And, as her eyes followed him from where she was
seated among the terrace flowers, she realized more than
ever that she did not know what to say to him, what
to do with him, or how to answer such a man.</p>

<p class="indent">Her face grew very serious; she was becoming more
deeply impressed with the seriousness of what he had
asked of her; of her own responsibility. And yet, as far
as love was concerned, she could find no answer for him.
Friendship, swift, devoted, almost passionate, she had
given him&mdash;a friendship which had withstood the hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
shocks of anger and distrust, and the more bewildering
shock of his kiss.</p>

<p class="indent">She still cared for him, relied on him; wished for his
companionship. But, beyond that, what had happened,
followed by his sudden demand, had startled and confused
her, and, so far, she did not know whether it was
in her to respond. Love loomed before her, mighty and
unknown, and the solemnity of its pledges and of its
overwhelming obligations had assumed proportions
which awed her nineteen years.</p>

<p class="indent">In her heart always had towered a very lofty monument
to the sacredness of love, fearsomely chaste, flameless,
majestic. So pure, so immaculate was this solemn
and supreme edifice she had already builded that the
moment&#39;s thrill in his arms had seemed to violate it. For
the girl had always believed a kiss to be in itself part
of that vague, indefinite miracle of supreme surrender.
And the knowledge and guilt of it still flushed her
cheeks at intervals and meddled with her heart.</p>

<p class="indent">She had forgiven, had tried to readjust herself before
her mystic altar. There was nothing else to do.
And the awakened woman in her aided her and taught
her, inspiring, exciting her with a knowledge new to her,
the knowledge of her power.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, as she sat there looking at this man and at
the brown-eyed girl beside him, suddenly she experienced
a subtle sense of fear: fear of what? She did not
know, did not ask herself. Not even the apprehension,
the dread of parting with him had made her afraid;
not even the certainty that he was going to join
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
his regiment had aroused in her more than a sense of
impending loneliness.</p>

<p class="indent">But something was waking it now&mdash;something that
pierced her through and through: and she caught her
breath sharply, like a child who has been startled.</p>

<p class="indent">For the first time in her life the sense of possession
had been aroused in her, and with it the subtle instinct
to defend what was her own.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked very intensely at the brown eyes of the
young girl who stood laughing and gossiping there
with the man she did not know how to answer&mdash;the man
with whom she did not know what to do. But every instinct
in her was alert to place upon this man the unmistakable
sign of ownership. He was hers, no matter
what she might do with him.</p>

<p class="indent">To Darrel, trying to converse with her, she replied
smilingly, mechanically; but her small ears were ringing
with the gay laughter of Valentine and the quick,
smiling responses of Guild as they stood with their
heads together over the contents of the fly-book, consulting,
advising, and selecting the most likely and murderous
lures.</p>

<p class="indent">Neither of them glanced in her direction; apparently
they were most happily absorbed in this brand new
friendship of theirs.</p>

<p class="indent">Very slowly and thoughtfully Karen&#39;s small head
sank; and she sat gazing at the brilliant masses of
salvia bloom clustering at her feet, silent, overwhelmed
under the tremendous knowledge of what had come
upon her here in the sunshine of a cloudless sky.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
"Au revoir!" called back Valentine airily; "we shall
return before dusk with a dozen very large trout!"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild turned to make his adieux, hat in hand; caught
Karen&#39;s eye, nodded pleasantly, and walked away across
the lawn, with Valentine close beside him, still discussing
and fussing over the cast they had chosen for the
trout&#39;s undoing.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>THE LIAR</h3>

<p class="indent">The lamps had not yet been lighted in the big,
comfortable living-room and late sunlight
striped wall and ceiling with rose where Karen
sat sewing, and Darrel, curled up in a vast armchair,
frowned over a book. And well he might, for it was
a treatise on German art.</p>

<p class="indent">His patience arriving at the vanishing point he
started to hurl the book from him, then remembering
that it was not his to hurl, slapped it shut.</p>

<p class="indent">Which caused Karen to lift her deep violet eyes inquiringly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Teutonic Kultur! I&#39;ve got its number," he said.
Which observation conveyed no meaning to Karen.</p>

<p class="indent">"German art," he explained. "It used to be merely
ample, adipose, and indigestible. Now the moderns
have made it sinister and unclean. The ham-fist has become
the mailed fist; the fat and trickling source of
Teutonic inspiration has become polluted. There is no
decadence more hideous than the brain cancer of a Hercules."</p>

<p class="indent">Karen followed him with intelligent interest. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
said with hesitation: "The moderns, I think, are wandering
outside immutable boundaries. Frontiers are
eternal. If any mind believes the inclosed territory exhausted,
there is nothing further to be found outside in
the waste places&mdash;only chaos. And the mind must shift
to another and totally different pasture&mdash;which also has
its boundaries eternal and fixed."</p>

<p class="indent">"Right!" exclaimed Darrel. "No sculptor can find
for sculpture any new mode of expression beyond the
limits of the materials which have always existed; no
painter can wander outside the range of black and white,
or beyond the surface allotted him; the composer can
express himself in music only within the limits of the
audible scale; the writer is a prisoner to grammatical expression,
walled always within the margins of the printed
page. Outside, as you say, lies chaos, possibly madness.
The moderns are roaming there. And some of them are
announcing the discovery of German Kultur where they
have barked their mental shins in outer darkness."</p>

<p class="indent">Karen smiled. "It is that way in music I think.
The dissonance of mental disturbance warns sanity in
almost every bar of modern music. It is that which is
so appalling to me, Mr. Darrel&mdash;that in some modernism
is visible and audible more and more the menace of
mental and moral disintegration. And the wholesome
shrink from it."</p>

<p class="indent">Darrel said: "Three insane &#39;thinkers&#39; have led Germany
to the brink where she now stands swaying. God
help her, in the end, to convalescence&mdash;" he stared at the
fading sunbeams on the wall, and staring, quoted:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&#39;<i>Over broken oaths and</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Through a sea of blood.&#39;"</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">He looked up. "I&#39;m sorry: I forget you are German."</p>

<p class="indent">"I forget that I am supposed to be, too.... But
you have not offended me. I know war is senseless. I
know that war will not always be the method used to
settle disputes. There will be great changes beginning
very soon in the world, I think."</p>

<p class="indent">"I believe so, too. It will begin by a recognition of
the rights of smaller nations to self-government. It will
be an area of respect for the weak. Government by
consent is not enough; it must become government by
request. And the scriptures shall remain no more sacred
than the tiniest &#39;scrap of paper&#39; in the archives of the
numerically smallest independent community on earth.</p>

<p class="indent">"The era of physical vastness, of spheres of influence,
of scope is dying. The supreme wickedness of the world
is Force. That must end for nations and for men. Only
one conflict remains inevitable and eternal; the battle
of minds, which can have no end."</p>

<p class="indent">For an American and an operator in real estate, Darrel&#39;s
philosophy was harmlessly respectable if not very
new. But he thought it both new and original, which
pleased him intensely.</p>

<p class="indent">As for Karen, she had been thinking of Guild for the
last few minutes. Her sewing lay in her lap, her dark,
curly head rested in the depths of her arm-chair. Sunlight
had almost faded on the wall.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
Through the window she could see the trees. The
golden-green depths of the beech-wood were growing
dusky. Against the terrace masses of salvia and geraniums
glowed like coals on fire. The brown-eyed girl had
been away with him a long while.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Courland came in, looking more youthful and
pretty than ever, and seated herself with her knitting.
The very last ray from the sinking sun fell on her ruddy
hair.</p>

<p class="indent">"Think you are right, Harry," she said quietly to
Darrel. "I think we will sail when you do. The men
on the place are becoming very much excited over this
Uhlan raid on the cattle. I could hear them from my
bedroom window out by the winter fold, and they were
talking loudly as well as recklessly."</p>

<p class="indent">"There&#39;s no telling what these forest people may do,"
admitted Darrel. "I am immensely relieved to know
that you and Valentine are to sail when I do. As for
Kervyn Guild&mdash;" he made a hopeless gesture&mdash;"his mind
is made up and that always settles it with him."</p>

<p class="indent">"He won&#39;t return with you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No. He&#39;s joining the Belgians."</p>

<p class="indent">"Really!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. You see his people were Belgian some generations
back. It&#39;s a matter of honour with him and
argument is wasted. But it hits me pretty hard."</p>

<p class="indent">"I can understand. He is a most delightful man."</p>

<p class="indent">"He is as straight and square as he is delightful. His
mother is charming; his younger brother is everything
you&#39;d expect him to be after knowing Kervyn. Theirs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
is a very united family, but, do you know I am as certain
as I am of anything that his mother absolutely
approves of what he is about to do. She is that sort.
It may kill her, but she&#39;ll die smiling."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Courland&#39;s serious, sweet eyes rested on him, solemn
with sympathy for the mother she had never met.</p>

<p class="indent">"The horrid thing about it all," continued Darrel, "is
that Kervyn is one man in a million;&mdash;and in a more
terrible sense that is all he can be in this frightful and
endless slaughter which they no longer even pretend to
call one battle or many.</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s a drop in an ocean, only another cipher in the
trenches where hell&#39;s hail rains day and night, day
and night, beating out lives without distinction, without
the intelligence of choice&mdash;just raining, raining, and
beating out life!... I can scarcely endure the thought
of Kervyn ending that way&mdash;such a man&mdash;my
friend&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">His voice seemed hoarse and he got up abruptly and
walked to the window.</p>

<p class="indent">Ashes of roses lingered in the west; the forest was
calm; not a leaf stirred in the lilac-tinted dusk.</p>

<p class="indent">Karen, who had been listening, stirred in the depths
of her chair and clasped her fingers over her sewing.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Courland said quietly:</p>

<p class="indent">"It is pleasant for any woman to have known such
a man as Mr. Guild."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," said Karen.</p>

<p class="indent">"If the charm of his personality so impresses us who
have known him only a very little while, I am thinking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
what those who are near and dear to him must feel."</p>

<p class="indent">"I, too," said Karen, faintly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yet she loves him best who would not have it otherwise
it seems."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; he must go," said Karen. "Some could not
have it&mdash;otherwise."</p>

<p class="indent">A man came to light the lamps. And a little while
after they were lighted Mrs. Courland quietly looked
up from her knitting. One swift, clear glance she
gave; saw in the young girl&#39;s eyes what she had
already divined must be there. Then bent again above
her ivory needles. After a while she sighed, very
lightly.</p>

<p class="indent">"They&#39;re late," remarked Darrel from the window.</p>

<p class="indent">"They are probably strolling up the drive; Valentine
knows enough not to get lost," said her mother.</p>

<p class="indent">After a few moments Karen said: "Would my playing
disturb you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, dear. Please!"</p>

<p class="indent">So Karen rose and walked to the piano. Presently
Darrel turned and seated himself to listen to the deathless
sanity of Beethoven flowing from the keys under
a young girl&#39;s slender fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">She was still seated there when Valentine came in, and
turned her head from the keyboard, stilling the soft
chords.</p>

<p class="indent">"We had such a good time," said Valentine. "We
caught half a dozen trout, and then I took him to the
Pulpit where we sat down and remained very quiet; and
just at sunset three boar came out to feed on the oak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
mast; and he said that one of them was worth shooting!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You evidently <i>have</i> had a good time," said Darrel,
smiling. "What happened to Guild. Did the boar
tree <i>him</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think he&#39;d be more likely to tree the boar," remarked
the girl. And to her mother she said: "He
went on toward the winter fold to talk to Michaud who
has just returned from Trois Fontaines. There were
a lot of men there, ours and a number of strangers. So
I left him to talk to Michaud. What have you all been
doing this afternoon?" turning to Karen, and from her,
involuntarily to Darrel.</p>

<p class="indent">"Miss Girard and I have conversed philosophically
and satisfactorily concerning everything on earth," he
said. "I wish my conversations with you were half as
satisfactory."</p>

<p class="indent">Valentine laughed, but there was a slight flush on her
cheeks, and again she glanced at Karen, whose lovely
profile only was visible where she bent in silence above
the keyboard.</p>

<p class="indent">"Your mother," remarked Darrel, "has decided to sail
with me. Would you condescend to join us, Valentine?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Mother, are you really going back when Harry
sails?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. I don&#39;t quite like the attitude of the men here.
And Harry thinks there is very likely to be trouble between
them and the Germans across the border."</p>

<p class="indent">The girl looked thoughtfully at her mother, then at
Darrel, rather anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
"Mother," she said, "I think it is a good idea to get
Harry out of the country. He is very bad-tempered,
and if the Germans come here and are impudent to us
he&#39;ll certainly get himself shot!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I! I haven&#39;t the courage of a caterpillar!" protested
Darrel.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re the worst fibber in the Ardennes! You <i>did</i>
kill that grey boar this morning! What do you mean
by telling us that you went up a tree! Maxl, the garde-de-chasse
at the Silverwiltz gate, heard your shot and
came up. And you told him to dress the boar and send
a cart for it. Which he did!&mdash;you senseless prevaricator!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, my!" said Darrel meekly.</p>

<p class="indent">"And you&#39;re wearing a bandage below your knee
where the boar bit you when you gave him the coup-de-grâce!
Maxl washed and bound it for you! What a
liar you are, Harry! Does it hurt?"</p>

<p class="indent">"To be a liar?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No! where you were tusked?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Maxl was stringing you, fair maid," he said
lightly.</p>

<p class="indent">"He wasn&#39;t! You walk lame!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Laziness and gout account for that débutante slouch
of mine. But of course if you care to hold my
hand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">The girl looked at him, vexed, yet laughing:</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t <i>want</i> people who do not know you to think
you really are the dub you pretend to be! Do you wish
Miss Girard to believe it?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
"Truth is mighty and must&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I know more about you than you think I do, Harry.
Mr. Guild portrayed for me a few instances of your
&#39;mouse&#39;-like courage. And I don&#39;t wish you to lose
your temper and be shot if the Uhlans ride into Lesse
and insult us all! Therefore I approve of our sailing
for home. And the sooner the better!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You frighten me," he said; "I think I&#39;ll ask Jean to
pack my things now." And he got up, limping, and
started for the door.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mother," she said, "that boar&#39;s tusks may poison
him. Won&#39;t you make him let us bandage it properly?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think you had better, Harry," said Mrs. Courland,
rising.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, no; it&#39;s all right&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Harry!" That was all Valentine said. But he
stopped short.</p>

<p class="indent">"Take his other arm, mother," said the girl with
decision.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked over her shoulder at Karen; the two
young girls exchanged a smile; then Valentine marched
off with her colossal liar.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>BEFORE DINNER</h3>

<p class="indent">Michaud, head forester, had taken off his grey
felt hat respectfully when Valentine introduced
him to Guild, there in the lantern light of the
winter sheep fold. A dozen or more men standing near
by in shadowy groups had silently uncovered at the
same time. Two wise-looking sheep dogs, squatted on
their haunches, looked at him.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the girl had left Guild there and returned to
the house.</p>

<p class="indent">"I should like to have a few moments quiet conversation
with you," said Guild; and the stalwart,
white-haired forester stepped quietly aside with him,
following the younger man until they were out of
earshot of those gathered by the barred gate of the
fold.</p>

<p class="indent">"You are Belgian?" inquired Guild pleasantly.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>De Trois Fontaines, monsieur.</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">It was a characteristic reply. A Belgian does not
call himself a Belgian. Always he designates his
nationality by naming his birthplace&mdash;as though the world
must know that it is in Belgium.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
"And those people over there by the sheep fold?"
asked Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"Our men&mdash;some of them&mdash;from Ixl, from the Black
Erenz and the White, from Lesse&mdash;one from Liège.
And there is one, a stranger."</p>

<p class="indent">"From where?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Moresnet."</p>

<p class="indent">"Has he any political opinions?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He says his heart is with us. It is mostly that way
in Moresnet."</p>

<p class="indent">"In Moresnet ten per cent of the people are Germans
in sympathy," remarked Guild. "What is this
man? A miner?"</p>

<p class="indent">"A charcoal burner."</p>

<p class="indent">"Does he seem honest?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, Monsieur," said the honest forester, simply.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild laid one hand on the man&#39;s broad shoulder:</p>

<p class="indent">"Michaud," he said quietly, "I know I am among
friends if you say I am. I mean friends to Belgium."</p>

<p class="indent">The dark eyes of the tall forester seemed to emit a
sudden sparkle in the dusk.</p>

<p class="indent">"Monsieur is American?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. My grandfather was Belgian."</p>

<p class="indent">"Monsieur is a friend?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Michaud, my name, in America is Guild. My name
in Belgian is Kervyn Gueldres. Judge, then, whether
I am a friend to your country and your king."</p>

<p class="indent">"Gueldres!" whispered the forester, rigid. "Kervyn
of Gueldres, Comte d&#39;Yvoir, Hastiere&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"It is so written on the rolls of the Guides."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
"Monsieur le Comte has served!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Two years with the colours. I am here to report
for duty. Do you feel safe to trust me now, Michaud,
my friend?"</p>

<p class="indent">The tall, straight forester uncovered. "Trust a
Gueldres! My God!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Put on your hat," said Guild, bluntly, "I am
American when I deal with men!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Monsieur le Comte&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"&#39;Monsieur&#39; will do. Give me your hand! That is
as it should be. We understand each other I think.
Now tell me very clearly exactly what happened this
morning on the hill meadows of the Paillard estate."</p>

<p class="indent">"Monsieur le&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Please remember!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Pardon! Monsieur Guild, the Grey Uhlans rode
over the border and laughed at the gendarme on duty.
Straight they made for our hill meadows, riding at
ease and putting their horses to the hedges. Schultz,
our herdsman, saw them trotting like wolves of the
Black Erenz, ran to the wooden fence to close the gate,
but their lances rattling on the pickets frightened him.</p>

<p class="indent">"They herded the cattle while their officers sat looking
on by the summer fold.</p>

<p class="indent">"&#39;Do not these cattle and sheep belong to the Paillard
estate?&#39; asks one of the officers of Schultz. And, &#39;Very
well then!&#39; says he; &#39;we are liquidating an old account
with Monsieur Paillard!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">"And with that a company of the Grey Ones canters
away across the valley and up the slope beyond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
where our shepherd, Jean Pascal, is sitting with his
two dogs.</p>

<p class="indent">"&#39;You, there!&#39; they call out to him. &#39;Send out your
dogs and herd your sheep!&#39; And, when he only gapes
at them, one of their riders wheels on him, twirling his
lance and shoves him with the counter-balance.</p>

<p class="indent">"So they make him drive his flock for them across
the valley, and then over the border&mdash;all the way on
foot, Monsieur; and then they tell him to loiter no more
but to go about his business.</p>

<p class="indent">"That is what has happened on our hill pasture. He,
the lad, Pascal, is over there with his dogs"&mdash;pointing
toward the fold&mdash;"almost crazed with grief and shame.
And, Schultz, he wishes us to organize as a franc-corps.
Me? I don&#39;t know what to do&mdash;what with Monsieur
Paillard away, and the forests in my care. Were it not
for my responsibility&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I know, Michaud. But what could an isolated franc-corps
do? Far better to join your class if you can&mdash;when
your responsibility here permits. Those young
men, there, should try to do the same."</p>

<p class="indent">"Monsieur is right! Even the classes of 1915, &#39;16,
and &#39;17 have been called. I have reminded them. But
this outrage on the hill pastures has inflamed them and
made hot-heads of everybody. They wish to take their
guns and hunt Grey Uhlans. They don&#39;t know what
they are proposing. I saw something of that in &#39;70.
Why the Prussians hung or shot every franc-tireur they
caught; and invariably the nearest village was burned.
And I say to them that even if Monsieur Paillard is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
dead, as many are beginning to believe, his death does
not alter our responsibility. Why should we bring reprisals
upon his roof, his fields, his forests? No, that
is not honest conduct. But if we are now really convinced
of his death, as soon as Madame Courland leaves,
let us turn over the estate to the proper authorities in
Luxembourg. Then will each and all of us be free to
join the colours when summoned&mdash;if God will only show
us how to do it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Madame Courland and mademoiselle ought to go tomorrow,"
said Guild. "One or another of your hotheads
over there might get us into trouble this very
night."</p>

<p class="indent">"The man from Moresnet talks loudest. I have tried
to reason with him," said Michaud. "Would you come
to the fold with me?"</p>

<p class="indent">They walked together toward the lantern light; the
men standing there turned toward them and ceased
their excited conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">"Friends," said old Michaud simply, "this gentleman&#39;s
name is Kervyn of Gueldres. I think that is sufficient
for any Belgian, or for any man from the Grand
Duchy?"</p>

<p class="indent">Off came every hat.</p>

<p class="indent">"Cover yourselves," continued Michaud calmly.
"Monsieur, who has become an American, desires to be
known as Monsieur Guild without further mark of respect.
This also is sufficient for us all, I suppose.
Thou! Jean Pascal, cease thy complaints and stand
straight and wipe thy tears. By God, I think there are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
other considerations in Lesse Forest than the loss of thy
sheep and of Schultz&#39;s cattle!"</p>

<p class="indent">"M-my sheep are gone!" blubbered the boy, "I was
too cowardly to defend them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Be quiet," said Guild. "It was not a question of
your courage! You did wisely. Show equal wisdom
now."</p>

<p class="indent">"But I shall go after Uhlans now with my fusil-de-chasse!
Ah, the cowards of Germans! Ah, the brigands&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Cowards! Assassins!" muttered the other. "Grey
wolves run when a man goes after them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"You are wrong," said Guild quietly. "Germans are
no cowards. If they were there would be no credit for
us in fighting them. Don&#39;t make any mistake you men
of the Ardennes; their soldiers are as brave as any soldiers.
And where you belong is with your colours, with
your classes, and in uniform. That&#39;s where I also belong;
that&#39;s where I am going if I can find out how to
go. Perhaps one of you can guide me. Think it over.
Keep cool, and listen to Michaud, who is older and wiser
than all of us."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a profound silence. Then a voice from the
darkness, very distinct:</p>

<p class="indent">"I have seen red. It is necessary for me to bleed an
Uhlan!"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild walked toward the sound of the voice: "Who
are you?" he demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Moi, je suis de Moresnet!</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">"Then you&#39;d better go back to the zinc mines of Moresnet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
my friend. No Uhlans will trouble you down
there."</p>

<p class="indent">And, aside to Michaud: "Look out for that young
man from Moresnet. He&#39;s too hotly a Belgian to suit
my taste."</p>

<p class="indent">"Monsieur, he is a talker," said Michael with a shrug.</p>

<p class="indent">"My friend, be careful that he is nothing more dangerous."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, sacré bleu!" exclaimed the forester, reddening to
his white temples&mdash;"if any of that species had the temerity
to come among us!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Michaud, they might even be among the King&#39;s own
entourage.... No doubt that fellow is merely, as
you say, a talker. But&mdash;he should not be left to wander
about the woods <i>alone</i>. And, tell me, is there anybody
else you know of who might do something rash tonight
along the boundary?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Monsieur&mdash;there are two or three poor devils who
escaped the firing squads at Yslemont. They live in
our forest, hiding. Our people feed them."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild said in a troubled voice: "Such charity is an
obligation. But nevertheless it is a peril and a menace
to us all."</p>

<p class="indent">"Were this estate my own," said the sturdy forester,
"I would shelter them as long as they desired to remain.
But I am responsible to Monsieur Paillard, and to his
tenant, Madame Courland. Therefore I have asked
these poor refugees to continue on to Diekirch or to
Luxembourg where the sight of an Uhlan&#39;s schapska
will be no temptation to them."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
"You are right, Michaud." He held out his hand;
the forester grasped it. "Tomorrow we should talk
further. Our duty is to join the colours, not to prowl
through the woods assassinating Uhlans. Good night!
In the morning then?"</p>

<p class="indent">"At Monsieur&#39;s service."</p>

<p class="indent">"And both of us at the service of the bravest man in
Europe&mdash;Albert, the King!"</p>

<p class="indent">Off came their hats. And, as they stood there in
silence under the stars, from far away across the misty
sea of trees came the sound of a gun-shot.</p>

<p class="indent">"One of your men?" asked Guild sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know, Monsieur. Big boar feed late. A
poacher perhaps. Perhaps a garde-de-chasse at Trois
Fontaines."</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope nothing worse."</p>

<p class="indent">"I pray God not."</p>

<p class="indent">They continued to listen for a while, but no other
sound broke the starry silence. And finally Guild
turned away with a slight gesture, and walked slowly
back to the Lodge.</p>

<p class="indent">Lights from the tall windows made brilliant patches
and patterns across terrace and grass and flowers; the
front door was open and the pleasant ruddy lamp-light
streamed out.</p>

<p class="indent">Valentine passing and mounting the stairs caught
sight of him and waved her hand in friendly salute.</p>

<p class="indent">"We&#39;re sterilizing Harry&#39;s shins&mdash;mother and I.
The foolish boy was rather badly tusked."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is he all right?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
"Perfectly, and bored to death by our fussing."</p>

<p class="indent">She ran on up the stairs, paused again: "We&#39;re not
dressing for dinner," she called down to him, and vanished.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild said, "All right!" glanced at the hall clock,
and sauntered on into the big living-room so unmistakably
American in its brightness and comfort.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was not until he had dropped back into the
friendly embrace of a stuffed arm-chair that he was
aware of Karen curled up in the depths of another,
sewing.</p>

<p class="indent">"I didn&#39;t know you were here," he said coolly. "Have
you had an agreeable afternoon?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, thank you."</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s a very charming place."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"I think the Courlands are delightful."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very."</p>

<p class="indent">"Miss Courland and I had a wonderful walk. We
had no trouble in taking all the trout we needed for dinner,
and then we went to a rock called The Pulpit,
where we lay very still and talked only in whispers until
three wild boars came out to feed."</p>

<p class="indent">Karen lifted her eyes from her sewing. They seemed
unusually dark to him, almost purple.</p>

<p class="indent">"After that," he went on, "we walked back along the
main ride to a carrefour where the drive crosses; and so
back here. That accounts for my afternoon." He
added, smiling carelessly: "May I ask you to account
for yours?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
"Yes, please."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well, then I do ask it."</p>

<p class="indent">She bent over her sewing again: "I have been
idle. The sun was agreeable. I went for a little stroll
alone and found an old wall and a pool and a rose
garden."</p>

<p class="indent">"And then?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The rose garden is very lovely. I sat there sewing
and&mdash;thinking&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"About what?"</p>

<p class="indent">"About&mdash;you&mdash;mostly."</p>

<p class="indent">He said steadily enough: "Were your thoughts
pleasant?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Partly."</p>

<p class="indent">"Only partly?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes.... I remembered that you are joining your
regiment."</p>

<p class="indent">"But that should not be an unpleasant thought for
you, Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">"No. I would have it so, of course. It could not
be otherwise under the circumstances."</p>

<p class="indent">"It could not be otherwise," he said pleasantly; but
his grey eyes never left the pale, sweet profile bent
above the leisurely moving needle.</p>

<p class="indent">"I understand."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know you understand <i>that</i>&mdash;at least, Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. Other matters, too&mdash;a little better than I did&mdash;this
morning."</p>

<p class="indent">"What matters?" he asked casually. But his heart
was threatening to meddle with his voice; and he set his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
lips sternly and touched his short mustache with careless
fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">Karen bent still lower over her sewing. The light
was perfectly good, however.</p>

<p class="indent">"What," he asked again, "are the matters which you
now understand better than you did this morning?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Matters&mdash;concerning&mdash;love."</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed: "Do you think you understand love?"</p>

<p class="indent">"A little better than I did."</p>

<p class="indent">"In what way? You are not in love, are you, Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think&mdash;a&mdash;little."</p>

<p class="indent">"With whom?"</p>

<p class="indent">No answer.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not with <i>me</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes." She turned swiftly in the depths of her chair
to confront him as he sprang to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">"Wait!" she managed to say; and remained silent,
one slim hand against her breast. And, after a moment:
"Would you not come any nearer, please."</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not now, please.... Sit there where you were....
I can tell you better&mdash;all I know&mdash;about it."</p>

<p class="indent">She bent again over her needle, sewing half blindly,
the hurrying pulses making her hand unsteady. After
he was seated she turned her head partly around for a
moment, looking at him with a fascinated and almost
breathless curiosity.</p>

<p class="indent">"If I tell you, you will come no nearer; will you?"
she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"No. Tell me."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
She sewed for a while at random, not conscious what
her fingers were doing, striving to think clearly in the
menace of these new emotions, the power of which she
was divining now, realizing more deeply every second.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll try to tell you," she said: "I didn&#39;t know anything&mdash;about
myself&mdash;this morning. What we had been
to each other I considered friendship. Remember it was
my first friendship with a man. And&mdash;I thought it <i>was</i>
that."</p>

<p class="indent">After a silence: "Was it anything deeper?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, deeper.... You frightened me at first....
I was hurt.... But not ashamed or angry. And I
did not understand why.... Until you spoke and said&mdash;what
you said."</p>

<p class="indent">"That I love you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes.... After that things grew slowly clearer to
me. I don&#39;t know what I said to you&mdash;half the things
I said on the way back&mdash;only that I made you angry&mdash;and
I continued, knowing that you were angry and that
I&mdash;I was almost laughing&mdash;I don&#39;t know why&mdash;only
that I needed time to try to think.... You can&#39;t
understand, can you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think so."</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up, then bowed her head once more.</p>

<p class="indent">"That is all," she said under her breath.</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing more, Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Only that&mdash;after you had gone away this afternoon
I began to be a little in love."</p>

<p class="indent">"Will it grow?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think so."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
"May I tell you that I love you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, please."</p>

<p class="indent">His clasped hands tightened on his knees; he said in
a low unsteady voice: "All my heart is yours, Karen&mdash;all
there is in me of love and loyalty, honour and devotion,
is yours. Into my mind there is no thought that
comes which is not devoted to you or influenced by my
adoration of you. I love you&mdash;every word you utter,
every breath you draw, every thought you think I love.
The most wonderful thing in the world would be that
you should love me; the greatest miracle that you might
marry me. Dare I hope for you, Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;please."</p>

<p class="indent">"That you will grow to really love me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"With all your heart?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think so."</p>

<p class="indent">In the tremulous silence she turned again and looked
at him, bending very low over her work.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you be gentle with me, Kervyn?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Dearest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I mean&mdash;considerate&mdash;at first.... There is a
great deal I don&#39;t know about men&mdash;and being in love
with one of them.... Brought up as I have been, I
could not understand that you should take me&mdash;in your
arms.... I was not angry&mdash;not even ashamed....
Only, never having thought of it&mdash;and taking it for
granted that, among people of your caste and mine, to
touch a man&#39;s lips was an act&mdash;of betrothal&mdash;perhaps
of marriage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
"Dearest, it <i>was</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I understand now. But for a while I felt&mdash;strangely&mdash;overwhelmed....
You can understand&mdash;having
no mother&mdash;and suddenly face to face
with&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">She leaned her cheek against the back of the chair
and rested so, her small white hands folded over her
sewing.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have yet to see Baron Kurt," she said half to herself.
"I shall say to him that I care for you. After
that&mdash;when you come back, and if you wish me to
marry you&mdash;ask me."</p>

<p class="indent">He stood up: "How near may I come to you,
Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not <i>very</i> near&mdash;just now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Near enough to kiss your finger-tip."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, please."</p>

<p class="indent">Without turning her head she extended her arm; his
lips touched lightly the fragrant skin, and she pressed
her fingers a trifle closer&mdash;a second only&mdash;then her arm
fell to her lap.</p>

<p class="indent">"After dinner," she said, "I shall show you the roses
in the garden."</p>

<p class="indent">"They are no sweeter than your hand, Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled, her flushed cheek still resting against the
cushions.</p>

<p class="indent">"It is very wonderful, very gentle after all," she
murmured to herself.</p>

<p class="indent">"What, Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I meant love," she said, dreamily.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>SNIPERS</h3>

<p class="indent">Dinner was ended. Darrel lay on a lounge in
the sitting-room, a victim against his will to
romance. Beside him on a low footstool sat
Valentine, reading aloud to him when she thought he
ought to be read to, fussing with his pillows when she
chose to fuss, taking his cigarette from his lips and
inserting a thermometer at intervals, and always calmly
indifferent to his protests or to her mother&#39;s laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">For she had heard somewhere that a wild boar&#39;s teeth
poisoned like a lion&#39;s mauling; and the sudden revelation
of a hero under the shattered shell of modesty and self-depreciation
which so long obscured the romantic qualities
in this young man determined her to make him continue
to play a rôle which every girl adores&mdash;the rôle
of the stricken brave.</p>

<p class="indent">Never again could Darrel explain to her how timidity,
caution, and a native and unfeigned stupidity invariably
characterized his behaviour at psychological moments.</p>

<p class="indent">For Guild had told her all about this young man&#39;s
cool resourcefulness and almost nerveless courage during
those hair-raising days in Sonora when the great Yo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
Espero ranch was besieged, and every American prisoner
taken was always reported "Shot in attempting to
escape."</p>

<p class="indent">She had never even known that Darrel had been in
Mexico until Guild told her about their joint mining
enterprise and how, under a spineless Administration,
disaster had wiped out their property, and had nearly
done the same for them.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mother," said the girl, "I think I&#39;ll look at his
shin again."</p>

<p class="indent">"Nonsense!" protested Darrel, struggling to sit up,
and being checked by a soft but firm little hand flat
against his chest.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t want to have my shin looked at," he repeated
helplessly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mother, I am going to change the dressing. Will
you help?"</p>

<p class="indent">"For the love of Mike&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Be quiet, Harry!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Then make Guild go out of the room! He&#39;s laughing
at me now!"</p>

<p class="indent">Karen was laughing, too, and now she turned to Guild:
"Come," she said, smilingly; "we are not welcome here.
Also I do want you to see the rose garden by star-light."
And to Mrs. Courland, naïvely: "May we please be excused
to see your lovely garden?"</p>

<p class="indent">The pretty young matron smiled and nodded, busy
with the box of first-aid bandages for which Valentine
was now waiting.</p>

<p class="indent">So Karen and Guild went out together into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
star-light, across the terrace and lawns and down along
a dim avenue of beeches.</p>

<p class="indent">The night was aromatic with the clean sweet odour
of the forest; a few leaves had fallen, merely a tracery
of delicate burnt-gold under foot.</p>

<p class="indent">Karen turned to the right between tall clipped hedges.</p>

<p class="indent">Mossy steps of stone terminated the alley and led
down into an old sunken garden with wall and pool and
ghostly benches of stone, and its thousands of roses
perfuming the still air.</p>

<p class="indent">They were all there, the heavenly company, dimly
tinted in crimson, pink, and gold&mdash;Rose de Provence,
Gloire de Dijon, Damask, Turkish, Cloth of Gold&mdash;exquisite
ghosts of their ardent selves&mdash;immobile phantoms,
mystic, celestial, under the high lustre of the stars.</p>

<p class="indent">Mirror-dark, the round pool&#39;s glass reflected a silvery
inlay of the constellations; tall trees bordered the wall,
solemn, unstirring, as though ranged there for some midnight
rite. The thin and throbbing repetition of hidden
insects were the only sounds in that still and scented
place.</p>

<p class="indent">They leaned upon the balustrade of stone and looked
down into the garden for a while. She stirred first,
turning a little way toward him. And together they
descended the steps and walked to the pool&#39;s rim.</p>

<p class="indent">Once, while they stood there, she moved away from
his side and strolled away among the roses, roaming at
random, pausing here and there to bend and touch with
her face some newly opened bud.</p>

<p class="indent">Slender and shadowy she lingered among the unclosing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
miracles of rose and gold, straying, loitering, wandering
on, until again she found herself beside the pool
of mirror black&mdash;and beside her lover.</p>

<p class="indent">"Your magic garden is all you promised," he said in
a low voice&mdash;"very wonderful, very youthful in its
ancient setting of tree and silvered stone. And now
the young enchantress is here among her own; and the
spell of her fills all the world."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you mean me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You, Karen, matchless enchantress, sorceress incomparable
who has touched with her wand the old-familiar
world and made of it a paradise."</p>

<p class="indent">"Because I said I loved you&mdash;a little&mdash;has it become
a paradise? You know I only said &#39;<i>a little</i>.&#39;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I remember."</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course," she added with a slight sigh, "it has become
more, now, since I first said that to you. I
shouldn&#39;t call it &#39;a little,&#39; now; I should call it&mdash;&mdash;"
She hesitated.</p>

<p class="indent">"Much?"</p>

<p class="indent">She seemed doubtful. "Yes, I think it is becoming
&#39;much&#39;&mdash;little by little."</p>

<p class="indent">"May I kiss&mdash;your hand?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, please."</p>

<p class="indent">"And clasp your waist&mdash;very lightly&mdash;<i>this</i> way?"</p>

<p class="indent">"In sign of betrothal?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up at him out of the stillest, purest eyes
he had ever beheld.</p>

<p class="indent">"You know best, Kervyn, what we may do."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
"I know," he said, drawing her nearer.</p>

<p class="indent">After a moment she rested her cheek against his
shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">Standing so beside the pool, breathing the incense of
the roses, she thought of the dream, and the gay challenge,
"Who goes there?" She was beginning to suspect
the answer, now. It was Love who had halted her
on that flower-set frontier; the password, which she had
not known then, was "Love." Love had laughed at her
but had granted her right of way across that border
into the Land of Dreams. And now, unchallenged,
save by her own heart, she had come once more to the
borderland of flowers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 471px;">
<a name="gs06" id="gs06"></a><img class="border" src="images/gs06.jpg" width="471" height="700" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">"Standing so beside the pool, breathing the incense of the
roses, she thought of the dream"</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">"Halt!" said her heart, alert; "who goes there?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It is I, Karen, wearing the strange, new name of
Love&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">She lifted her head, drew one hand swiftly across her
eyes as though to clear them, then stepped free from
the arm that encircled her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I&mdash;I do love you," she stammered&mdash;"with all&mdash;all
my heart&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Halt!</i>" rang out a voice like a pistol shot from the
darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl stood rigid; Guild sprang to her side. "Qui
vive!" cried the voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Belgium!" said Guild coolly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then who goes there!&mdash;you!&mdash;below there in that
garden?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Friends to Belgium," replied Guild in a quiet and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
very grave voice. "Don&#39;t move, dearest," he whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">"What is happening?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know, yet."</p>

<p class="indent">Presently, nearer the balustrade above them, the voice
came again: "Is it Monsieur Guild?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. Who are you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Pardon. Will Monsieur come up to the terrace? I
am watching the wall beyond the pool."</p>

<p class="indent">They ascended the stone steps; Karen moving lightly
beside him. In the shadow of the clipped yews a dark
form stirred.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pardon. I did not recognize Monsieur Guild nor
Mademoiselle. There is trouble."</p>

<p class="indent">It was Schultz the herdsman; his rifle was in his hand
and he wore two cartridge-belts crossed over his smock
en bandoulière.</p>

<p class="indent">He touched his hat to Karen, but turned immediately
toward the star-lit sky-line where the dark coping of
the wall cut it.</p>

<p class="indent">"What is the trouble?" asked Guild with a sinking
heart.</p>

<p class="indent">"God knows how it happened, Monsieur Guild&mdash;but
there was bad blood tonight and hot heads full of it.
Then, very far in the forest, a shot was fired."</p>

<p class="indent">"I heard it. What happened?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Listen, Monsieur! The Moresnet man and the boy,
Jean Pascal, put their heads together. I don&#39;t know
how it was, but even after what you said to us, and
after Michaud told us to remain prudent and calm,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
somehow after we heard that shot we all, one by one,
took down our guns; and after a little while we found
ourselves together in the carrefour.</p>

<p class="indent">"And from there we went, without saying a word, to
the Calvary on the hill pasture road. It was as though
each of us understood without telling each other&mdash;without
even hinting at a plan.</p>

<p class="indent">"And by and by we went down by the rivulet at the
foot of the hill pastures, and there, as we expected,
were two of the Yslemont refugees. They had their
guns. And one of them had a <i>spiked helmet</i>."</p>

<p class="indent">"Go on," said Guild, compressing his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"He had taken it near Trois Fontaines, not below
the hill. We all examined it. We saw red, Monsieur.
Then a calf which had escaped the Grey Wolves moved
in the bushes near us. The Moresnet man caught it,
and he and the shepherd, little Jean Pascal, took the
dumb beast and tied it to a sapling near the road. On
<i>our</i> side of the boundary! But we all knew what might
happen."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a silence; then Schultz said in a low,
hoarse voice: "It was fated to be. We took both sides
of the road in the long grasses of the ditches. And the
calf bawled for company.</p>

<p class="indent">"The company came after a while&mdash;two Grey
Wolves. First we heard the clink-clink of their horses&#39;
feet; then we saw their lances against the sky.</p>

<p class="indent">"They came on, picking their way. And of a sudden
the electric breast-torch on one of them breaks
out like a blinding star, plays over the road, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
lights up the calf which is terrified and backs into the
hedge.</p>

<p class="indent">"He drives his lance-butt into the sod and gets out
of his saddle. His comrade sits the other horse, pistol
lifted, elbow on thigh. And there comes then another
Uhlan, walking and leading his horse&mdash;three of the
dirty brigands, Monsieur, across the border and on our
side!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Go on."</p>

<p class="indent">"Eh bien&mdash;we bled them!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You killed them?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, Monsieur&mdash;two there by the hedge in the grassy
ditch; the other hung to his horse for a while&mdash;but came
off sideways. One spur caught and his horse took him
back that way&mdash;across the border."</p>

<p class="indent">"Go on."</p>

<p class="indent">"We took their schapskas. Jean Pascal wished to go
across the border after more Wolves. He was crazy.
And the blood made us all a little drunk. And then we
found that the Moresnet man had gone. That chilled
us."</p>

<p class="indent">He wiped his face with his sleeve, never taking his
eyes from the wall across the garden.</p>

<p class="indent">"After that," he said, "we lay very still, watching.
And in a little while an Uhlan crossed the hill pasture
walking his horse slowly against the stars. Then there
were others moving across the sky up there, and we
also heard others on the road. So we have been quietly
falling back into the forest where, if they follow, they
shall not go back, please God!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
"Where is Michaud?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He was very angry, but, since the affair has really
begun, he is with us, of course."</p>

<p class="indent">"Where is he?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He went to the house to find you an hour ago."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild bit his lip in silence. The stupidity of what
had been done, the utter hopelessness of the situation
sickened him.</p>

<p class="indent">The slow, groping peasant mind, occupied always
with the moment&#39;s problem only, solving it by impulse
and instinct alone&mdash;what could be done with such a mind&mdash;what
could be hoped from it except under patiently
inculcated military discipline.</p>

<p class="indent">Loosened from that, and defending its property from
actual or threatened aggression, it became a furtive,
fierce and quickened mind, alternately cunning and
patiently ferocious. But of reason, or of logic, it
reckons nothing, knows nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">Trouble had begun&mdash;trouble was abroad already in
the star-light&mdash;moving, menacing.</p>

<p class="indent">"What is your word?" he asked bluntly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yslemont."</p>

<p class="indent">He turned to Karen, who stood quietly beside him:
"The ladies must leave this house tonight. There is
no time at all to waste. There is going to be real trouble
here by morning. And I am going to ask you if you
will give these American ladies shelter tonight at Quellenheim.
Will you, Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course."</p>

<p class="indent">"From there they can go to the city of Luxembourg
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
tomorrow, and so into Holland. But they ought to go
now."</p>

<p class="indent">"And you, Kervyn?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall be very busy," he said. "Come back to the
house, now."</p>

<p class="indent">They walked away together, moving quickly along the
beech-woods; she with that youthful, buoyant step as
lithe as a young boy&#39;s; he beside her with grave, preoccupied
face and ears alert for the slightest sound.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you come back to Quellenheim, too?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t do that, dearest."</p>

<p class="indent">"May I ask you what you are going to do?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Dear, I don&#39;t know yet. I haven&#39;t formed any plan
at all."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it not very dangerous for you to remain here?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I think not.... That is&mdash;I shall see how this
matter threatens to develop."</p>

<p class="indent">He felt her hand lightly on his arm, looked around,
halted. She came to him, laid her cheek against his
breast in silence.</p>

<p class="indent">"You must not be afraid for me, Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall try&mdash;to remember."</p>

<p class="indent">He lifted one of her hands. It was cold and delicately
fragrant. He kissed it.</p>

<p class="indent">"The Bank at Diekirch is my address. I shall try
to write you. I shall come back some day and marry
you. Do you love me, Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"With all&mdash;all my&mdash;soul."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
"And you will marry me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, Kervyn."</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up, her eyes brilliant as wet stars. And
very gently, almost timidly, they exchanged their betrothal,
lip to lip.</p>

<p class="indent">He drew her to him a little closer&mdash;held her so a moment,
scarcely in contact. Then they turned again to
the grassy ride and moved swiftly forward toward the
drive.</p>

<p class="indent">Every light in the house had been lit, apparently.
The automobile stood before the door; three forest waggons
with their big fine horses were in line behind; and
servants were loading them with American trunks, suitcases,
and luggage of every description, under the
active direction of Darrel.</p>

<p class="indent">When he saw Guild and Karen coming he called out:
"Your luggage is packed! Mrs. Courland and Valentine
and their two maids are filling hampers with bed
linen and knick-knacks. You&#39;ve heard what&#39;s happened,
of course?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," said Guild. "I don&#39;t think you had better
waste any more time packing. Let the ladies get into
the car and start. Michaud and I can gather up what&#39;s
left of their effects and send it after them in the last
waggon! Where is Michaud?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Talking to Mrs. Courland inside. Here he comes,
now!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">The white-haired forester came out behind Mrs.
Courland, caught sight of Guild, and made a slight gesture
expressing infinite despair.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
"I know," said Guild. "I&#39;ll talk it over with you
after the household leaves." And to Mrs. Courland,
who appeared calm but a trifle dazed: "Miss Girard
offers you Quellenheim for the night, and for longer if
you desire."</p>

<p class="indent">"Please," said Karen, coming forward&mdash;"it would be
very gracious of you to come. Will you, Mrs. Courland?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Thank you, dear&mdash;yes&mdash;it will be the greatest convenience.
I don&#39;t know when we should arrive at Luxembourg
if we started now." She took one of Karen&#39;s
hands and turned to Guild: "What a terrible thing our
people have done! Michaud came to tell us; Harry
started everybody packing up. You will come with us,
of course?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps later, thank you." He turned to Valentine
who was coming out in hat and coat, followed by a
pale-faced maid carrying both arms full of wraps.</p>

<p class="indent">"Please don&#39;t lose any time," said Guild, selecting
wraps for Mrs. Courland and for Karen. "Are your
servants ready?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nobody is ready," said Valentine, "but everybody
is here or in the hall, I think."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild gave his arm to Mrs. Courland and helped
that active young matron spring into the touring car.
Karen went next. Valentine and two maids followed;
Guild slammed the door.</p>

<p class="indent">"All right!" he said curtly to the chauffeur, then,
hat in hand, he said gaily: "Au revoir! A happy reunion
for us all!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
As the car rolled out into the shining path of its own
lamps Karen turned and looked back at him. And as
long as he could see her she was looking back.</p>

<p class="indent">After the car followed two of the forest waggons, one
filled with servants, the other loaded with luggage.
Darrel came out of the house with the last odds and ends
of property belonging to the Courlands and flung it
pell-mell into the last waggon.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come on," he said briskly to Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, go ahead, Harry. I&#39;m stopping to talk with
Michaud&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well how are you going to get to Quellenheim?"</p>

<p class="indent">"When I&#39;m ready to go I&#39;ll get there."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re not coming?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not now."</p>

<p class="indent">Darrel came over and said, dropping his voice:
"After this murdering business it won&#39;t do for <i>you</i> to
be caught here."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t mean to be caught here. Don&#39;t worry&mdash;and
get a move on!"</p>

<p class="indent">"What are you intending to do?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know yet. Come, Harry, start that waggon!"</p>

<p class="indent">Darrel shrugged his shoulders, mounted the seat beside
the driver, and the forest waggon rolled away into
the darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild was still looking after it, listening to Michaud&#39;s
report of the sniping affair near Trois Fontaines,
when he saw the figure of a man walking back from the
direction the waggon had taken. The man walked with
a visible limp.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
"You idiot!" said Guild sharply as Darrel strolled
up, his features blandly defiant.</p>

<p class="indent">"Go on with what you were saying to Michaud," insisted
Darrel, unruffled by his reception.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come, Harry&mdash;this is downright damn foolishness.
If you&#39;ve let the waggon go on, you&#39;ll have to foot it
to Quellenheim. You can&#39;t stay here!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because, you infernal butter-in, you&#39;ll get mixed
up in a particularly nasty mess. And it doesn&#39;t concern
Yankees, this mess we&#39;re in, Michaud and I."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh hell!" said Darrel; "go on and talk, Michaud!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you going to poke your nose into this?" demanded
Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s in now."</p>

<p class="indent">"See here, Harry! Your sticking by me is gratuitously
silly and it annoys me. You don&#39;t have to.
This isn&#39;t any of your business, this mess."</p>

<p class="indent">Darrel lighted a cigarette and sat down on the terrace
steps. Guild glared at him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you go to the devil!" he snapped out.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I won&#39;t."</p>

<p class="indent">Michaud, perplexed, had remained silent.</p>

<p class="indent">"If things go wrong they&#39;ll make a clean sweep of
us all, I tell you," said Guild. "Once more, Harry, will
you mind your own business?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No," said Darrel, blandly.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild turned to Michaud: "What were you saying?"</p>

<p class="indent">The forester, controlling his anger and emotion, continued
the story of the sniper near Trois Fontaines.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
Then he outlined the miserable affair of the hill pasture.</p>

<p class="indent">"There remains for us now only two courses," he
ended. "Either we turn franc-tireur and make our
bivouac yonder in the forest, or we gather our people
at The Pulpit, lie there tonight, and at daylight strike
out for the Dutch frontier."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">"There is a little hole in the rocks at The Pulpit&mdash;scarce
large enough to be called a cave. Since the war
came upon us, foreseeing necessity, my men have carried
arms and provisions to The Pulpit&mdash;well hidden,
Monsieur. I think, now, that it is a better refuge than
this house."</p>

<p class="indent">The three men looked up at the house. Michaud
made a hopeless gesture: "I suppose <i>they</i> will destroy
it, now. God knows. But if Monsieur Paillard be truly
dead as we now believe, and his poor body lies rotting
under the ruins of Wiltz-la-Vallée, then there is nobody
to mourn this house excepting the old forester, Michaud....
And I think he has lived on earth too long."</p>

<p class="indent">He went slowly toward the house, entered it. One by
one all the lighted windows grew dark. Presently he
reappeared drawing the door-key from his pocket. Very
deliberately he locked the door from the outside, looked
in silence at the darkened house, and, facing it, quietly
removed his hat.</p>

<p class="indent">The silent salute lasted but a moment; he put on his
grey hat with the pheasant&#39;s feather sticking up behind,
picked up his fowling-piece and hung it over one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
shoulder, his big, weather-browned hand resting on the
sling.</p>

<p class="indent">"Eh bien, Messieurs?" he inquired calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Bring in your men, Michaud," said Guild. "I know
where The Pulpit is, but I couldn&#39;t find it at night. I&#39;ll
wait at the carrefour for you." And, to Darrel:
"What did you do with my luggage?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Sent it to Quellenheim."</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>That rücksack, too?</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Damnation," said Guild very calmly; "it had papers
in it which are enough to hang anybody!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;d better go and get it, then."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll have to, that&#39;s all."</p>

<p class="indent">They walked across the lawn and out along the dark
drive in silence. Where the ride crossed at the carrefour
they halted. There was a dilapidated shrine there
to Our Lady of Lesse. They seated themselves on the
stone base.</p>

<p class="indent">"Harry," said Guild, "how long do you intend to
follow me about in this absurd way?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;d like to see you safe across the Dutch frontier."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks," said Guild drily.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t mention it. I really can reconcile myself to
your having your bally head knocked off in uniform,
but this sort of thing seems rather ghastly."</p>

<p class="indent">"It is. Won&#39;t you go on to Quellenheim to oblige
me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll wait till tomorrow morning," replied Darrel
pleasantly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
Guild was silent. They sat there for an hour or more
scarcely exchanging a word. Then somebody whistled,
cautiously, very near them, and another carefully modulated
whistle answered.</p>

<p class="indent">"Who goes there!" came a challenging voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yslemont!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Our men," said Guild, rising.</p>

<p class="indent">Michaud came up in the darkness. "The shepherd,
Jean Pascal, and Schultz, and the men of Yslemont are
out there yet. Nothing I say affects them. They say
that they need another Uhlan to bleed. Imbeciles!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Won&#39;t they obey you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, by God! The two sheep dogs of Jean are there,
grave and wise as two big-eared devils squatting. And
the half-crazed lad is teaching them to track Uhlans&mdash;making
them sniff the bloody schapskas like a hunter
who trains pups with a dead hare!"</p>

<p class="indent">He looked around at the dozen shadowy figures gathering
in the carrefour; the star-light sparkled on guns
and belts and slings, and here and there on the vizor
of a casquette-de-chasse.</p>

<p class="indent">"The Grey Wolves," said Michaud, "can never find
us in The Pulpit. If Monsieur is ready?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Quite ready," said Guild. And the shadowy file,
led by Michaud, moved straight into the woods.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>DRIVEN GAME</h3>

<p class="indent">The stars had faded; a watery grey light glimmered
through the forest. Deer crossed the
grassy carrefour by the shrine, picking a
dainty way toward forest depths; rabbits hopped homeward
through dew-drenched ferns and bracken; a cock-pheasant
saluted the dawn; the last wild boar still lingered
amid the beech mast, rooting, coughing, following
the furrows that his bristly snout was making while
his furry bat-like ears, cocked forward, remained on
duty, and his tail wriggled pleasurably.</p>

<p class="indent">The silent watchers aloft behind the rocky escarpement
of The Pulpit, looking down through leafy
branches to the carrefour, saw the last little roedeer
trot past on his fastidious way; saw the last rabbit vanish
in the warren; saw the lone boar lift his huge and
shaggy head to listen with piggish suspicion, then turn
and go, silent as some monstrous spectre.</p>

<p class="indent">From under hazel bushes pheasants stepped out to
ruffle and preen and peck pensively among the fallen
leaves, awaiting the promise of the sun, their white collars
gleamed below their gorgeous heads; the sombre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
splendour of their plumage made brilliant spots along
the ride. Here and there a hen-pheasant crept modestly
about the business of breakfast. A blue and rosy jay
alighted near, sign that the forest peace promised to
endure.</p>

<p class="indent">After a long while far in the west the grey was
touched with rose. Darrel, lying beside Guild, chin on
his folded arms, stirred slightly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sunrise," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Michaud, on the other side, reared himself on his
hands and lay watching the west.</p>

<p class="indent">"It is too early for the sun," he said. "That is a
fire."</p>

<p class="indent">Pinker, ruddier, redder grew the western sky. Silent,
intent, forester, garde-de-chasse, charcoal burner,
strained their keen eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Then a heavy sigh like a groan escaped Michaud.</p>

<p class="indent">"The Lodge," he said, hoarsely, under his breath.
"Oh God, my master&#39;s home."</p>

<p class="indent">All around among the rocks men were drawing deep
breaths, muttering, restless; their eyes were fixed like
the eyes of caged wild things.</p>

<p class="indent">"The Grey Wolves," growled an old garde&mdash;"Ah,
the cowards&mdash;the dirty Prussian whelps! Ah! Look at
that; my God! Marie adored, Virgin of Lesse; stand
by us now!"</p>

<p class="indent">Against the sky specks like tinsel twinkled; smoke
became visible.</p>

<p class="indent">"House, stables, granneries, quarters, garage, all
are on fire," said Michaud in a mechanical voice. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
face was grey and without expression, his words accentless.</p>

<p class="indent">The smoke appeared further north.</p>

<p class="indent">"The cattle-barns and the hay-stacks," he went on
monotonously.... Beyond are the green-houses, runs,
dove-cotes, and our little shop.... They are now
afire... Everything is on fire. Lesse is burning,
burning.... The stubble beyond is burning....
And beyond that the nursery acres&mdash;the seedlings and
the&mdash;Marie adored, Virgin of Lesse, have pity on my
little trees&mdash;my nurslings&mdash;my darlings&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Hark!" whispered Guild. Far away up the ride
horses were coming at a heavy trot; and now the noise
of wheels became audible. And now below them two
German dragoons cantered into view, carbines poised;
a waggon passed&mdash;a strange grey vehicle driven by a
grey-clad soldier wearing a vizorless forage cap. It
was piled with dead pigeons and chickens. Behind that
another waggon followed, all splashed with blood, and
in it swayed and jolted the carcasses of dead pigs freshly
killed, lurching and slipping over the crimsoned straw.
Behind galloped six Uhlans, their lances perpendicular
in the buckets, the cords from their cloth-covered
schapskas bellying behind.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not a shot!" said Michaud in a perfectly distinct
voice, pushing up the rifle of the old garde-de-chasse.
"There is nothing to do now, nom de Dieu!&mdash;for the
necks of our fowls are already wrung and the dead hogs
are tasting their own <i>boudin</i>. Our affair is with the
living pigs."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
After a few moments more dragoons came, trotting
their superb horses along the ride, alertly scanning the
woods to right and left as they passed, their carbines
at a ready.</p>

<p class="indent">Waggons followed&mdash;hay waggons, carts loaded with
potato sacks, straw, apples, bags of flour, even firewood
and bundles of faggots&mdash;a dozen vehicles or more
of every description.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ours," said Michaud in his emotionless tones.
"What they could not take is burning yonder."</p>

<p class="indent">More grey dragoons closed the file of waggons, then
a dozen Uhlans, who turned frequently in their saddles
and kept looking back.</p>

<p class="indent">"Scoundrels!" muttered the garde-de-chasse, laying
his rifle level; but Michaud turned on him and struck
up the weapon.</p>

<p class="indent">"Thou!" he said coldly&mdash;"do thy duty when I tell
thee, or I become angry."</p>

<p class="indent">Somebody said: "There are no more. We have not
bled one single wolf!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Look yonder," whispered Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">Out into the carrefour stepped briskly eight or ten
German officers, smart and elegant and trim in their sea-grey
uniforms and their spiked helmets shrouded with
grey so that there was not a glitter from point to spur.</p>

<p class="indent">A dozen non-commissioned officers followed, carrying
two military rifles apiece.</p>

<p class="indent">The officers looked curiously at the shrine of Our
Lady of Lesse, and the sad-faced Virgin looked back
at them out of her carven and sightless eyes.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
One by one the officers took posts at the four corners
of the grassy clearing or on the steps of the shrine.
They were laughing and conversing; some smoked;
some inspected the rifles brought up by their non-com
gun-bearers. The sun had not yet risen; the silvery
smoke of the Silverwiltz marked its high waterfall below
the gorge of the glen; fern fronds drooped wet to the
wet dead leaves beneath, matted grasses glistened powdered
with dew.</p>

<p class="indent">In the still grey air of morning the smoke from the
German officers&#39; pipes and cigars rose upward in
straight thin bands; a jeweled bracelet on the wrist of
an infantry major reflected light like a frost crystal.</p>

<p class="indent">The officers ceased their careless conversation; one
by one they became quiet, almost motionless where they
had taken their several positions. Behind them, stiff
and erect, the non-coms stood with the spare guns, rifles
or fowling-pieces.</p>

<p class="indent">An air of silent expectancy settled over the carrefour;
officer and non-com were waiting for something.</p>

<p class="indent">Michaud had already divined; Guild knew; so did
Darrel. Every woodsman in The Pulpit knew. Some
of them were trembling like leashed dogs.</p>

<p class="indent">Then in the forest a sound became audible like a far
halloo. Distant answers came through the woodland
silence, from north, from south&mdash;then from west and
east.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild whispered to Darrel: "They are driving the
forest! They have a regiment out to beat it!"</p>

<p class="indent">The German officers at their stands no longer moved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
as much as a finger. Against the grey trees they were
all but invisible.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly out into the carrefour stepped a superb
red stag, ears alert, beautiful head half turned at gaze.
Instantly a rifle spoke; and the magnificent creature
was down in the ride, scuffling, scrambling, only to fall
and lie panting with its long neck lifted a little.</p>

<p class="indent">Crack! The antlered head fell.</p>

<p class="indent">Then out of the wood trotted three bewildered pigs&mdash;an
old boar, a yearling on which the stripes were still
visible, and a huge fierce sow. A ripple of rifle shots
checked them; the old boar stood swinging his great
furry head right and left; the yearling was down,
twitching; the sow ran, screaming horribly. Two shots
followed; the old boar kneeled down very quietly like a
trick-horse in a circus, still facing his enemies. He
did not look as though he were dead.</p>

<p class="indent">The yearling had ceased its twitching; the sow was
down, too, a great lump of coarse black fur in the ditch.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the rifles began again; a company of little roe
deer whirled into the ride and went down or stumbled
with delicate limbs dangling broken, or leaped to a
height incredible in the agony of a death wound.</p>

<p class="indent">Pell-mell after them galloped a whole herd of red
deer; the German rifles rattled steadily. Now and then
blasts from fowling-pieces dropped running or incoming
pheasants, cock and hen alike; or crumpled up some
twisting rabbit or knocked a great hare head over heels.</p>

<p class="indent">Faster and faster came the terrified wild things, stag,
roe, boar, and hare; steadily the German rifles cracked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
and rattled out death; thicker and swifter pelted the
meteor flight of pheasants; birds of all sorts came driving
headlong in their flight; big drab-tinted wood-pigeons, a
wild duck or two, widgeon and mallard; now and then a
woodcock fluttered past like some soft brown bat beating
the air; now and then a coq-de-la-bruyere, planing
on huge bowed wings above collapsed and fell heavily
to the loose roar of the fowling-pieces.</p>

<p class="indent">Crippled, mutilated creatures were heaped along the
ride; over them leaped their panic-stricken comrades
only to stumble in the rifle-fire and lie struggling or
inert.</p>

<p class="indent">A veil of smoky haze made the carrefour greyer now,
through which at intervals a dying stag lifted its long
neck from the shambles about him or some strong
feathered thing beat its broken wings impotently upon
the grass.</p>

<p class="indent">Once a great boar charged, and was shot to pieces,
spattering the steps of the shrine with blood. Once a
wounded hare dragged its tortured body to the shrine,
as though for sanctuary. A non-com swung it crashing
against the granite cross.</p>

<p class="indent">And now a more sinister thing occurred. Out from
the forest, amid the stampeding game, reeled a man!
His blue smock hung in ribbons; one bleeding fist
grasped a rifle; the cartridges en bandoulière glittered.</p>

<p class="indent">For a second he stood there, swaying, panting, bewildered
in the smoke haze; then three non-coms fired
at him at once.</p>

<p class="indent">At that he straightened up, stood so for a second as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
though listening, then he took one uncertain step and
pitched into a patch of briers on his face.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently some German foot-soldiers appeared in the
ride, moving cautiously, scanning every ditch, every
hollow, every thicket, their rifles poised for a snap-shot.
A roebuck floundered up and went off before them like
the wind, unnoticed. Then one of the soldiers fired,
and a boy jumped out from behind a hazel bush and
started to run along the edge of the woods. He was
followed by two sheep dogs.</p>

<p class="indent">"Jean Pascal!" said Michaud calmly. "May God
pardon him now."</p>

<p class="indent">As the little shepherd ran, the soldiers stood and
fired at him, aiming carefully. They broke his leg as
he passed the carrefour. The lad raised himself from
the ground to a sitting position and was sobbing bitterly,
when they shot him again. That time he fell
over on his side, his hands still covering his dead
and tear-wet face. His dogs trotted around him,
nuzzling him and licking his hands. An officer shot
them both.</p>

<p class="indent">Schultz broke cover in a few moments, his rifle at
his cheek; and, dropping to one knee in the ride, he
coolly opened fire on the officers by the shrine. But
he had time only for a single shot which jerked a spiked
helmet from a cavalry major&#39;s clipped head. Then they
knocked him flat.</p>

<p class="indent">As the herdsman lay gasping in the roadway with
a bullet in his stomach, looking with dull and glazing
eyes at the rifle flashes, three men from Yslemont&mdash;blackened,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
haggard, ragged creatures&mdash;burst out, fighting
like wildcats with the beaters behind them.</p>

<p class="indent">Two were bayoneted and clubbed to death in the
briers; the last man ran like a crazed hare, doubling,
dodging, twisting among the trees where the rifle hail
filled the air with twigs and splinters and tattered leaves.</p>

<p class="indent">After him lumbered a dozen foot-soldiers, clumping
along in their hob-nailed ammunition boots. Then, high
above on The Pulpit, Guild spoke sharply to Michaud,
who gave a jerk to his white head and made a little
gesture to the others behind him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now," added Guild in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Fire," said Michaud calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">The rocky glen roared with the volley. The foot-soldiers
below halted in astonishment and looked up.
One fell sideways against a tree; another dropped to his
knees and remained motionless, the spike of his helmet
buried deep in the soft earth.</p>

<p class="indent">They were shouting down by the carrefour now;
clear, mellow whistle signals sounded persistently.
Horses were coming, too; the ride reverberated with
their galloping. And all the while The Pulpit resounded
with the rifle-fire of its little garrison, and soldiers were
dropping along the carrefour and the ride.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 535px;">
<a name="gs07" id="gs07"></a><img class="border" src="images/gs07.jpg" width="535" height="700" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">"The Pulpit resounded with the rifle-fire of its little garrison"</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">"Pigs of Prussians!" shouted the old garde-de-chasse;
"does a Belgian game-drive suit you now! Ah,
scoundrels, bandits, sound the <i>Mort</i> on your imbecile
whistles. For the swine of the North are dying fast!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Be silent," said Michaud coldly. "You tarnish your
own courage!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span>
Guild and Darrel had taken rifles; they stood firing
down at the carrefour where the horses of the Uhlan
advanced guard were plunging about in disorder under
a confusion of lances and fluttering pennons.</p>

<p class="indent">But the confusion lasted only a few moments; horsemen
whirled their mounts and cleared out at full speed;
the carrefour was empty of officers now; not a German
was visible in the early sunshine, only the steady clatter
of their rifle-fire continued to pelt the heights where
bullets cracked and smacked on the rocks.</p>

<p class="indent">"Enough," said Michaud quietly. "It is time to
leave. André, bring thou a bar to me."</p>

<p class="indent">A charcoal burner ran to the hole in the rocks and
drew out a crowbar. Michaud took it, shoved it under
the edge of the ledge, found a fulcrum, motioned the
men back.</p>

<p class="indent">Two other men threw their weight on the bar; the
ledge lifted easily. Suddenly the entire parapet gave
way, crashing like an avalanche into the glen below.</p>

<p class="indent">"They shall need wings who follow us," said the old
man grimly. "Monsieur," turning calmly to Guild,
"if we cross the Dutch border unarmed, will they interne
us?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I think not."</p>

<p class="indent">"And from there we may be free to find our way to
the colours?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"By sea?"</p>

<p class="indent">"By land and sea to Dunkirk. I know of no easier
or quicker way."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
"Monsieur goes with us?"</p>

<p class="indent">"First I must stop at Quellenheim." He added, in a
low voice: "By mistake my papers were sent there last
night. Our King must see those papers."</p>

<p class="indent">"Bien," said Michaud. "We bivouac near Quellenheim
tonight&mdash;time for a crust, Monsieur, while you
go to the house and return. Is it agreeable to Monsieur?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Perfectly." And, to Darrel: "Take your chance
while it remains and join the Courlands when they leave
Quellenheim. Will you promise?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll see," said Darrel, carelessly tossing his rifle
across his shoulder and stepping into the silent file of
men which was already starting across the ridge.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>CANDLE LIGHT</h3>

<p class="indent">It was nearly eleven o&#39;clock at night before they
bivouacked without fires in the woods behind the
Lodge at Quellenheim.</p>

<p class="indent">The circuitous forest route had wearied the men; they
threw themselves on the dead leaves and moss; some
slept where they lay, others groped in sacks with toil-stiffened
fingers searching for crusts, which they
munched slowly, half asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild drew Darrel and Michaud aside.</p>

<p class="indent">"To go by Luxembourg and Holland is too long and
too uncertain," he said. "If we could cross the railway
beyond Trois Fontaines before daylight we should have
a clear country before us to Antwerp."</p>

<p class="indent">It had been days since the household at Lesse had
heard any war news, but Darrel recollected that there
had been rumours of a German drive toward Antwerp.</p>

<p class="indent">Michaud nodded. "It is possible," he said. "Brussels
they may have taken; I don&#39;t know; but Antwerp,
never! I <i>know</i>, Monsieur; I served my time
with the artillery in the Scheldt forts. No German
army could pass the outer ring of fortresses; the country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
can be flooded. Also our King is there with his
Guides and Lancers and Chasseurs-à-cheval; the entire
army is there. No, Monsieur, Antwerp is open to us if
you desire to take us there."</p>

<p class="indent">"I do," said Guild. "It is the better way for all of
us if the country still remains clear. It is better for us
than to engage in a Chasse aux Uhlans. If I could lead
a dozen sturdy recruits into Antwerp it would be worth
while. And, except for the post at Trois Fontaines and
the troops patrolling the railway, I can not see why the
country is not open to us north of Liège."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know this country. It is my country," said Michaud,
"and troops or no troops I can take you across
the railroad before daylight." He shrugged his massive
shoulders: "What is a Prussian patrol to a head forester?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You believe you can do it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I pledge my honour, Monsieur."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild looked at Darrel: "I wish I knew whether there
has been a drive toward Antwerp. If there has been it
must have come from the sea by Ostend. But I do not
believe Ostend has been taken." He turned to Michaud:
"If the country is clear, why could we not pick up more
men en route? Why should we not recruit in every
hamlet, every village?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Mon Dieu, Monsieur, if there are hardy companions
willing to go with the ragged men of the forest,
well and good. Yet I could wish for at least one uniform
among us. That represents authority and gives
security."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
Guild said thoughtfully: "I have an officer&#39;s uniform
of the Guides among my luggage."</p>

<p class="indent">"Lord!" exclaimed Darrel, "you brought it with
you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"There was to have been a regimental dinner in Brussels
in September. I was asked last June, and they requested
me to wear uniform. I had my uniform, so
I packed it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then it is there in your luggage at Quellenheim!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," said Darrel heartily, "I&#39;m devilish glad of it.
If they catch you in uniform they can&#39;t court-martial
you with a jerk of their thumbs."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m not worrying about that," said Guild carelessly,
"but," looking at Michaud, "if you think a reserve
officer in uniform is likely to encourage recruiting, I
certainly shall use my uniform. You know your own
people better than I do. I leave it to you, Michaud."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then, Monsieur, wear your uniform. It means
everything to us all; we honour and respect it; it represents
authority; better still, it reassures our people. If
an officer of the Guides is seen in charge of a batch
of recruits, no young man, whose class has been summoned
to the colours, would entertain any misgivings.
Nor dare anybody hang back! Our women would jeer
and ridicule them."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well," said Guild. "Now take me as far as the
wood&#39;s edge where I can see the house at Quellenheim.
Wait for me there and guide me back here, for I never
could find this dark bivouac alone."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
"Follow, Monsieur," said the old man simply.</p>

<p class="indent">In single file the three men moved forward through
the darkness, Michaud leading without hesitation, Guild
following close, and Darrel bringing up the rear.</p>

<p class="indent">In a few minutes the bluish lustre of the stars broke
through the forest&#39;s edge. An overgrown ride ran
westward; beyond, the highway from Trois Fontaines
bisected it; and out of this curved the Lodge road.</p>

<p class="indent">It was dark and deserted; and when Guild came in
sight of the Lodge, that, too, was dark.</p>

<p class="indent">Up the long avenue he hastened to the house; the
fountain splashed monotonously in the star-light; the
circle of tall trees looked down mournfully; the high
planets twinkled.</p>

<p class="indent">He walked around the house, hoping to find a light
in the kitchen. All was black, silent, and wrapped in
profoundest shadow.</p>

<p class="indent">He picked up a few pebbles from the driveway,
counted the windows until he was certain which one
was Karen&#39;s. Her window was open. He tossed a
pebble against it; and then another into the room
itself.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly the girl appeared at the window.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen!" he called. She leaned out swiftly, her
braided hair falling to the sill.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn!" she whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">"Dear, I&#39;ve only a moment. Could you come down
and let me in without waking the others?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The others? Kervyn, they have gone!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Gone!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
"Everybody&#39;s gone! A patrol of hussars galloped
here from Trois Fontaines and ordered them across the
Dutch frontier. I felt dreadfully; but there was nothing
to do. So poor Mrs. Courland and her daughter
and her servants have gone on toward Luxembourg with
all their luggage. I&#39;m here alone with the Frau Förster.
Shall I let you in?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Did my luggage go to Luxembourg?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No; it is in the room you occupied."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then come down quickly and let me in," he said.
"If there are German patrols abroad I don&#39;t care to be
caught here."</p>

<p class="indent">The girl disappeared; Guild went to the front door
and stood looking down the driveway and listening to
catch any warning sound.</p>

<p class="indent">The next moment the door behind him opened and
Karen&#39;s trembling hands were in his.</p>

<p class="indent">He gazed down into the pale face framed by its heavy
braids. In her slim nightdress and silken chamber robe
she appeared very girlish.</p>

<p class="indent">"What has happened, Kervyn? Your clothes are
torn and muddy and you look dreadfully white and
tired."</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen, they burned Lesse this morning."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh!" she gasped.</p>

<p class="indent">"Everything at Lesse is in ashes. Some of the men
are dead. The survivors are in the woods behind your
house waiting for me."</p>

<p class="indent">She clung to his arm as they entered the house; Guild
picked up one of the lighted candles from the oak table.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
She took the other and they ascended the stairs together.</p>

<p class="indent">"There was sniping," he said. "That always brings
punishment to innocent and guilty alike. Lesse is a
heap of cinders; they drove the forest and shot the
driven game from the steps of the carrefour shrine.
Men fell there, too, under their rifles&mdash;the herdsman,
Schultz, the Yslemont men, the little shepherd lad with
both his dogs. When their bearers came our way we
fired on them."</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>You!</i> Oh, Kervyn! It means death if they find
you!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall not be found." He took her by the hands a
moment, smiled at her, then turned swiftly and entered
his room holding the candle above his head.</p>

<p class="indent">After his door had remained closed for a few moments
she knocked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn," she called, "I am frightened and I am
going to dress."</p>

<p class="indent">"No need of that," came his voice; "I shall be gone
in five minutes."</p>

<p class="indent">But she went away with her lighted candle and
entered her room. The travelling gown she wore from
England lay ready; boots, spats, and waist.</p>

<p class="indent">Swiftly she unbraided and shook out her hair and
twisted it up again, her slim fingers flying. A sense
of impending danger seized and possessed her; almost
feverishly she flung from her the frail night garments
she wore, and dressed with ever-increasing fear of something
indefinitely menacing but instant. What it might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
be she did not even try to formulate in thought; but it
frightened her, and it seemed very, very near.</p>

<p class="indent">She dragged on her brown velvet hat and pinned it,
and at the same moment she heard a sound in the hallway
which almost stopped her heart.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the ringing step of a spurred boot.</p>

<p class="indent">Terrified, she crept to her door, listened, opened a
little way. Near the stair-head a candle shone, its yellow
light glimmering on the wall of the passage. Then
she heard Guild&#39;s guarded voice:</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Y-yes," she faltered in amazement as a tall figure
turned toward her clothed in the complete uniform of
the Guides.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn! Is it <i>you</i>? Why are you in that uniform?"
She came toward him slowly, her knees still
tremulous from fear, and rested one hand on his arm.</p>

<p class="indent">"Dearest, dearest," he said gently, "why are you
trembling? There is no reason for fear. I am in uniform
because I shall attempt to take a few recruits and
volunteers across the railway line tonight. We are
going to try to make Antwerp, which is a quicker, and
I think a surer, route than through Luxembourg and
Holland. Besides, they <i>might</i> interne us. They would
without a doubt if I were in uniform and if the Lesse
men came to the frontier with their guns and bandoulières."</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn, how <i>can</i> you get to Antwerp? You can&#39;t
<i>walk</i>, dear!"</p>

<p class="indent">"We&#39;ll start on foot, anyway," he said cheerfully.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span>
"Now I must go. They&#39;re waiting. Why did you dress,
Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know." She looked up at him in a dazed
way. "I wanted to be with you."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m going back to the forest, dear."</p>

<p class="indent">"Could I come?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No. I don&#39;t want you to be out at night. There&#39;s
only a fireless camp there and a dozen ragged and dirty
men. Besides, there might be some sort of trouble."</p>

<p class="indent">"Trouble?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not likely. Still there <i>might</i> be patrols out from
Trois Fontaines, even from Lesse. I don&#39;t know. Michaud
says he can take us across the railway line before
daylight. If he can do that I think we shall find the
country clear beyond. Anyway, we&#39;ll know soon.
Now I must say good-bye."</p>

<p class="indent">She laid her cold hands in his, tried to speak, but
could not. Then, of a sudden, her fingers gripped his
in terror; there came the rushing swish of an automobile
around the gravel circle outside, a loud resonant humming,
a sharp voice speaking in German, a quick reply
in the same tongue.</p>

<p class="indent">"The&mdash;the valet&#39;s room. Quick!" she gasped, pushing
him backward across the room and through the
doorway. Behind him the swinging leather door closed
silently again; the girl stood rigid, white as a sheet, then
she walked to the oak table, picked up a book, and
dropped into the depths of a leather arm-chair.</p>

<p class="indent">Outside the mellow whirr of the motor had ceased;
the door of the car closed with a click; quick, firm steps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
ascended the path; there came a low jingling sound,
the clash of metal, then a key was rattled in the outer
lock, turned sharply, and the door creaked open.</p>

<p class="indent">Karen rose to her feet. Every atom of colour had
fled her cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You?" she said in a ghost of her own voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Kurt von Reiter seemed astonished. He came forward
very quickly, a tall, thin, faultless figure moulded
perfectly into his tight sea-grey uniform. Bending
only a very little from the waist as though too tightly
buttoned in, he bowed above the icy hand she extended,
paid his respects with flawless courtesy, straightened
up, placed his shrouded spiked helmet on the table.</p>

<p class="indent">"I had scarcely expected to find you awake," he said.
"It is after two o&#39;clock in the morning."</p>

<p class="indent">She made a supreme effort at self-control.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have been a trifle nervous, Kurt. There was trouble
at Lesse Forest last evening."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. Who told you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I was there."</p>

<p class="indent">"At Lesse!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, a guest of Mrs. Courland&mdash;an American lady."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know about her. She is a friend of Mr. Guild."</p>

<p class="indent">Karen nodded; a painful and fixed smile quivered in
her colourless lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"Was Mr. Guild there also?" inquired von Reiter.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"He left with the others, I suppose."</p>

<p class="indent">She said: "Everybody was in a panic. I invited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span>
them to come here, but a patrol from Trois Fontaines
galloped up and ordered them to go through Luxembourg&mdash;across
the Dutch frontier. It seemed very
harsh."</p>

<p class="indent">The girl had seated herself again; von Reiter drew
up a chair beside the table opposite her and sat down.
Candle light played over his dry, sandy-blond face and
set his blue eyes glittering.</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you well, Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Quite, thank you. And you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"God be thanked, in perfect health." He did not
mention three broken ribs still bandaged and which had
interfered with the perfectly ceremonious bow of a German
officer.</p>

<p class="indent">He said: "I took this opportunity to come. It was
my first chance to see you. Been travelling since noon."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&mdash;remain tonight?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I can not. I came for one reason only. You know
what it is, Karen."</p>

<p class="indent">She did not answer.</p>

<p class="indent">He waited a moment, looked absently around the
room, glanced up at the stag&#39;s antlers, then his gaze
returned to her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Were you much frightened by what happened at
Lesse?" he asked. "You do not look well."</p>

<p class="indent">"I am well."</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you experience any trouble in leaving England?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, some."</p>

<p class="indent">"And Mr. Guild? Was he&mdash;useful?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span>
"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">Von Reiter gazed at the girl thoughtfully. One elbow
rested on the table corner, the clenched fist supporting
his chin. In the other hand he continued to crumple
his gloves between lean, powerful, immaculate fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen," he said, "did you bring with you whatever
papers you happened to possess at the time?"</p>

<p class="indent">After a moment the girl answered in a low voice:
"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you destroy them?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"What became of them?" he insisted. A mottled
flush gathered on his cheek-bones; after a few seconds
the carefully scrubbed features of the man grew pink.</p>

<p class="indent">"What papers had you?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up at him in silence and a deeper colour
stained his face so that in contrast his pale mustache,
en croc, and his clipped hair appeared almost white.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kurt," she said, "how could you permit me to be
involved in such matters?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen, do you imagine I supposed that war with
England was imminent? I never dreamed that England
would intervene! And when she did, and when it
was already too late to reach you, the anxiety concerning
you, and concerning what papers might still be
passing from the Edmeston Agency through your
hands, nearly drove me insane."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yet you instructed me to bring back with me any
papers I might have in my possession."</p>

<p class="indent">"I tell you I did not count on war with England.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span>
Nobody did. I meant only that you were to bring
with you what papers you had when you returned. Did
not Grätz instruct you to destroy your papers?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">Von Reiter&#39;s lean jaws snapped. "Then what did
you do with them?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I put them into my satchel. On board the steamer
the satchel was opened and the papers taken."</p>

<p class="indent">Anger, apprehension, twitched at his thin lips; then
a deeper emotion softened the grim lines of his features.</p>

<p class="indent">"God be thanked," he said, "that you were not involved
in England. It was a living nightmare to me&mdash;that
constant uncertainty concerning you. I could not
reach you; I could do nothing, make no arrangements.
Cipher code was forbidden even from neutral countries.
It was only at the last moment I found a secret wireless
lane still open to us. In that way I managed to notify
Grätz that this man Guild was on his way to find
you and bring you back here; that no more papers
were to be sent through you to me; and that what you
had were to be destroyed. Did you hear from him at
all?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He telephoned that my maid had been arrested on
a serious charge and that I was to leave Hyacinth Villa
at once with Mr. Guild. He said nothing about papers.
But I remembered what I had promised you, and I put
into my satchel what papers I had.... They nearly
lost me my life," she added, gazing steadily at him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you mean to say that you knew the papers were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span>
compromising and still you undertook to bring them?
Were you insane to attempt such a thing?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Had I not promised you, Kurt?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Circumstances alter conditions and absolve promises
however solemn. Common sense decides where honour
is involved."</p>

<p class="indent">She flushed brightly: "There I am more English than
German, Kurt. A promise is a promise, and not"&mdash;she
looked at him musingly&mdash;"not what the British press
reproaches us for calling a &#39;scrap of paper.&#39;"</p>

<p class="indent">He said grimly: "When a supposed friend suddenly
aims a blow at you, strike first if you can and discuss
the ethics afterward. We tore up that &#39;scrap of paper&#39;
before the dirty fingers of England could clutch it,
that&#39;s all."</p>

<p class="indent">"And lost the world&#39;s sympathy. Oh, Kurt!"</p>

<p class="indent">"But we retained the respect born of fear. We invaded
Belgium before the others could do it, that&#39;s all....
I do not care to discuss the matter. The truth
is known to us and that is sufficient."</p>

<p class="indent">"It is not sufficient if you desire the sympathy of the
world."</p>

<p class="indent">Von Reiter&#39;s eyes became paler and fixed and he worried
the points of his up-brushed mustache with powerful,
lean fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">"Make no mistake," he said musingly. "America&#39;s
turn will come.... For all the insolence she has
offered in our time of need, surely, surely the time is
coming for our reckoning with her. We have not forgotten
von Diederichs; we shall not forget this crisis.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg&nbsp;312]</span>
All shall be arranged with method and order when
we are ready.... Where is that American&mdash;or Belgian,
as he seems to think his honour of the moment
requires him to be?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Guild?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"He did not come here when the others arrived from
Lesse Forest."</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s a fire-brand," said von Reiter coldly. "Our
system of information informed us sufficiently. I should
have had him extinguished at Yslemont had he not been
the one man who stood any chance of getting into England
and bringing you back."</p>

<p class="indent">"Also you trusted him," she said quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I did. He is a Gueldres of Yvoir. The Gueldres
have never lied. When he said he&#39;d return, that
settled the matter." Von Reiter&#39;s eyes had an absent
look as though following a detached idea, and his features
became expressionless.</p>

<p class="indent">"When the war ends," he said, "and if that man ever
comes to Berlin, it would afford me gratification to offer
him my hand&mdash;or my card. Either extreme would suit
me; he is not a man to leave one indifferent; it is either
friendship or enmity&mdash;the hand or the card. And I
do not know yet which I might prefer."</p>

<p class="indent">He looked up and around at her, his sombre, blond
features hardening:</p>

<p class="indent">"I need not ask you whether his attitude toward you
was respectful."</p>

<p class="indent">"It was&mdash;respectful."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
"That question, of course, answered itself. The record
of that family is part of Belgian history.... Do
you know where he went after he kept his word and
delivered you here?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He went to Lesse."</p>

<p class="indent">"And then?"</p>

<p class="indent">She remained silent.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you know?" he repeated.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is there any reason why you should not tell me?"</p>

<p class="indent">She was mute.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen," he said gently, "is there any reason why
your confidence should be withheld from me? I have
come here tonight for my answer. I have only an hour
to stay. It was a long way to come for one single word
from a young girl. But I would have travelled the
world over for that word from you. Will you give me
my answer, Karen?"</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up, dumb, her mouth tremulous, unable
to control her emotion for the moment. His keen eyes
searched hers; he waited, thin lips compressed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kurt&mdash;I&mdash;do not love you," she whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">He took it in silence; not a muscle quivered.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you marry me, Karen, and try?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I can not."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it your profession? Is it your desire for liberty?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it&mdash;<i>another man</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent">As he spoke he saw in her eyes that he had guessed
the truth.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg&nbsp;314]</span>
For a full minute he sat there like a statue, one arm
extended on the table, the bony hand clenched. After
a long while he lifted his head and turned upon her a
visage terrifying in its pallour and rigidity.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it&mdash;Guild?" he asked with an effort.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kurt!"</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Is</i> it?" The heavy colour suddenly flooded his face;
lie drew a deep, sharp breath. "Is he still in this neighbourhood?
Is he, perhaps, coming here to see you? Is
<i>that</i> why you are awake and dressed at this hour?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Kurt, you have no right&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I am at liberty to ask you these questions&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No! It is an impertinence&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you regard it that way? Karen! Is <i>this</i> what
has happened&mdash;" He choked, turned his congested face,
glaring about him at the four walls of the room. Suddenly
some instinct of suspicion seized him, possessed
him, brought him to his feet in one bound. And instantly
the girl rose, too.</p>

<p class="indent">"I know why you are awake and dressed!" he said
harshly. "You <i>are</i> expecting him! Are you?"</p>

<p class="indent">She could not answer; her breath had deserted her, and
she merely stood there, one hand resting on the table,
her frightened eyes fixed on the man confronting her.</p>

<p class="indent">But at his first step forward she sprang in front of
him. She strove to speak; the infernal blaze in his eyes
terrified her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is <i>this</i> what you have done to me?" he said; and
moved to pass her, but she caught his arm, and he
halted.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg&nbsp;315]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>A PERSONAL AFFAIR</h3>

<p class="indent">"My God!" he said, "it would not surprise me to
find him here in the house!... He <i>is</i> here&mdash;or
you would never wear a face like that!...
What do you mean to do, block my way in my own
house?" as she confronted him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kurt&mdash;" Her white lips merely formed the word.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Is</i> he here? Answer me!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Answer me!"</p>

<p class="indent">Behind them a voice broke in quietly: "I&#39;ll answer
for us all.... Don&#39;t touch that holster, General! I
can kill you first.... Now, then, am I to pass that
door without violence?... Because I&#39;m going to pass
it one way or another&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He came forward, his naked sabre shining in the candle
light, his grey eyes level, cool, and desperate.</p>

<p class="indent">Von Reiter stared at this tall young fellow in the
gay uniform of the Guides. His hand, which had instantly
moved toward his holster, remained suspended.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am going out of that door," repeated Guild.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span>
"Will General Baron von Reiter be good enough to
move aside?"</p>

<p class="indent">The German&#39;s eyes narrowed. "So," he said very
quietly, "it is not to be the hand after all, but an
exchange of cards. I am not sorry&mdash;" With a
movement too swift for the eye to follow, his sword
was out and glittering in his hand, and he sprang
on Guild, beating at his guard, raining blows like lightning.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl had fallen against the table, one hand at her
throat as though choking back the bursting cry of
fright; her brain rang with the dissonance and metallic
clamour; the flashing steel dazzled her. Two oak chairs
fell crashing as Guild gave ground under the terrific
onslaught; there was not a word spoken, not a sound
except the infernal din of the sabres and the ceaseless
shifting of armed heels on the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly von Reiter went down heavily; the doormat
slipping under foot had flung him to the floor with
a crash across a fallen chair. After a second or two he
groaned.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild looked down at him, bewildered, sword in hand&mdash;watched
him as he struggled to his feet. The German
was ghastly white. A fit of coughing shook him and
he tried to disguise it with his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pick up your sabre!" motioned Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">Von Reiter stooped, recovered his sword, adjusted the
hilt to his hand. He coughed again, and there was a
trace of blood on his lips, but his face was dead white.
He looked very steadily at Guild.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg&nbsp;317]</span>
"Acknowledgments to the Comte d&#39;Yvoir," he said
with an effort; and the shadow of a smile touched his
thin, grim lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do I pass?" demanded Guild, as grimly.</p>

<p class="indent">Von Reiter started to speak, and suddenly his mouth
was full of blood.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kurt," cried the girl in an agonized voice, "do you
mean to kill him or that he is to kill <i>you</i>!&mdash;<i>here</i>&mdash;before
my face?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I mean&mdash;just&mdash;that!"</p>

<p class="indent">He sprang at Guild again like a tiger, but Guild was
on him first, and the impact hurled von Reiter against
the table. His sabre fell clattering to the floor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="gs08" id="gs08"></a><img class="border" src="images/gs08.jpg" width="600" height="523" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">"The impact hurled von Reiter against the table"</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">For a moment, white as a corpse, he looked at his
opponent with sick eyes, then, suddenly faint, he slid
into the great leather chair. There was more blood on
his lips; Guild, breathing heavily, bent over and looked
at him, ignorant of what had happened.</p>

<p class="indent">Karen came and took his hand in hers. Then a slight
groan escaped him and he opened his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you badly hurt?" asked Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m a little sick, that&#39;s all. I think when I fell some
ribs broke&mdash;or something&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I meant fairly by you," said Guild miserably.</p>

<p class="indent">"You played fair. It was bad luck&mdash;bad luck&mdash;that&#39;s
all." He closed his pain-sickened eyes: "God,
what luck," he mumbled&mdash;"really atrocious!"</p>

<p class="indent">Guild, still holding his naked sword, drew his automatic
with his left hand. Then he looked silently at
Karen.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[pg&nbsp;318]</span>
"Can&#39;t you leave the house by the garden?" she whispered
tremulously.</p>

<p class="indent">"The gate is padlocked."</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn, they&#39;ll kill you if you step out of that
door!"</p>

<p class="indent">Von Reiter, drowsy with pain, opened his eyes:</p>

<p class="indent">"No, they won&#39;t," he said. "Be kind enough to
speak to my aide. I&mdash;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m rather&mdash;ill."</p>

<p class="indent">He glanced at Guild: "Honour of an officer," he
added weakly.</p>

<p class="indent">Karen stepped to the door and flung it open.</p>

<p class="indent">"Captain!" she called sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">A moment later the young hussar aide-de-camp who
had escorted Guild to the British lines came clanking
in.</p>

<p class="indent">He glanced obliquely at Guild and at Karen, but
when his eyes fell on von Reiter he stared, astonished.
Nevertheless, his spurred heels clicked together at
salute.</p>

<p class="indent">Von Reiter&#39;s eyes became ironical. He looked for a
moment at his aide, then his gaze wandered to Karen and
to Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where do you desire to go?" he asked with an effort.</p>

<p class="indent">"To Antwerp."</p>

<p class="indent">"The road is still open." And, to the hussar: "Safe
conduct for Captain the Comte d&#39;Yvoir across the railway.
Write it now."</p>

<p class="indent">"And for my comrade, Mr. Darrel, and ten recruits,"
said Guild quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">"And for his comrade, Mr. Darrel, and ten recruits,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[pg&nbsp;319]</span>
repeated von Reiter in a failing voice. But he was
smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">"And&mdash;for <i>me</i>!" said Karen.</p>

<p class="indent">Von Reiter&#39;s eyes had almost closed; he opened them
again, heavily, as she spoke. Karen bent over him:</p>

<p class="indent">"Kurt, I must go. I can not remain here now. Besides&mdash;I
want&mdash;my&mdash;husband."</p>

<p class="indent">"Think well," he said drowsily. "Think diligently&mdash;at
this moment&mdash;solemn&mdash;supreme&mdash;" He raised himself
a little, then relapsed: "God," he murmured, "what
luck to meet with under your own roof!..." And, to
the hussar: "Write it that Miss Karen Girard goes
also&mdash;if she so desires."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a silence. The hussar scribbled on the
stamped paper in his tablets. After he had finished he
laid the tablets and the fountain pen on von Reiter&#39;s
knees. Very slowly the latter affixed his signature.</p>

<p class="indent">He said to the hussar: "I am ill. Go to Trois Fontaines
and bring me a medical officer."</p>

<p class="indent">When the hussar had gone and when the whirr of the
automobile had died away down the drive, Guild aided
the hurt man to a sofa and Karen brought pillows from
a bedroom.</p>

<p class="indent">He was very thirsty, too, and she gave him water
continually. At intervals there were slight signs of
mental wandering, perhaps symptoms of pneumonia,
from his crushed ribs, for he coughed a great deal and
the fever already reddened his blond skin. But in the
main his mind seemed to be clear. He opened his light-blue
eyes and glanced at Guild continually.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg&nbsp;320]</span>
"Bad luck, old chap," he said in English, "but no
reflection on you. Just bad luck, bad, very bad! We
Germans usually have an ally in God. But the trinity
is incomplete without luck."</p>

<p class="indent">Guild said in a low voice: "I am really sorry, von
Reiter. I hope you will come out all right. God
knows I bear you no ill will."</p>

<p class="indent">"Many thanks. I shall come out all right. There
is much work to do." A ghost of the ironical
smile touched his feverish lips again. "And much
work to be done after this business in Europe is settled....
I mean in America. She must pay her reckoning.
She must settle with us Germans.... I
wish it might come soon&mdash;-<i>now!</i>&mdash;while their present
administration remains&mdash;while yet this dull President
and his imbecile and grotesque cabinet ministers are
in power.... I beg your pardon&mdash;seeing you in
that uniform made me forget that you are also <i>Mr.
Guild</i>."</p>

<p class="indent">But the irony in his wearied eyes made it very plain
that he had not forgotten.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen?" he said presently. She leaned forward in
her chair beside him.</p>

<p class="indent">"It was just bad luck, very bad luck," he muttered;
"but yours is luck"&mdash;he turned his dulled eyes toward
Guild&mdash;"luck to be envied.... Some day I hope it
may be&mdash;the hand."</p>

<p class="indent">"It is now, if you wish," said Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">The other shook his head: "Too soon, too soon," he
muttered. "Even a German officer has his&mdash;limits. Between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>[pg&nbsp;321]</span>
you and my luck I&#39;m in a bad way&mdash;a very bad
mess."</p>

<p class="indent">Karen bent over his hand and touched it with her lips.</p>

<p class="indent">The fever was gaining; he began to roll his blond
head from side to side, muttering of love and luck and
of the glory of God and the German Empire. A slight
smile remained on his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">Before the automobile arrived from Trois Fontaines
the fever seized him fiercely. His coughing racked him
incessantly now, and the first heavy hemorrhage soaked
his grey tunic and undershirt.</p>

<p class="indent">They eased him all they could, laying open his broad
blond chest and the ribs now terribly discoloured where
his fall had crushed them in again under the bandage.</p>

<p class="indent">How the man could have risen and come at him again
Guild could not understand. He was terribly shocked.</p>

<p class="indent">Dreadful sounds came from his laboured breathing;
he lay with eyes closed now, one burning hand lying in
Karen&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">Toward four o&#39;clock in the morning a far, faint sound
penetrated the room.</p>

<p class="indent">Von Reiter&#39;s eyes opened. "Halt!" he whispered.
"Who goes there?"</p>

<p class="indent">It was Death. He seemed to understand that, for he
sighed very lightly, his hand closed on Karen&#39;s, and he
lay gazing straight upward with brilliant eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">A few moments later there came a rush, a crunching
of gravel, the loud purr of the motor outside.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Karen opened the door and a medical officer
entered the room in haste.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>[pg&nbsp;322]</span>
Guild turned to Karen: "I must go to the woods
and bring in my men and Darrel. Dearest, are you
decided to go with me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I could not remain here now. I do not wish to."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then wait for me," he said, and went out into the
night.</p>

<p class="indent">A few moments later they took von Reiter upstairs
to his own room. His mind seemed to clear again for a
while and he said feebly but distinctly to his aide-de-camp:</p>

<p class="indent">"My daughter and her fiancé, the Comte d&#39;Yvoir, are
going to Antwerp for their wedding. I remember that
military trains now leave Trois Fontaines by way of
Trois Vierges, Liège, and Lesten. We control to Lesten,
I think."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, Excellence."</p>

<p class="indent">"Write for me that my daughter and the Comte
d&#39;Yvoir shall be accorded transportation as far as we
control. You will take them to Trois Fontaines in my
automobile; you will make personal requisition of the
chef-de-gar for the privacy of a compartment. You
will affix to the outside of the compartment a notice that
the persons in possession are travelling on my business
and under my personal protection, and that they are not
to be detained or interfered with in any way....
Write it separately to be affixed." His voice was weak
but perfectly distinct.</p>

<p class="indent">The hussar wrote steadily in his tablets, finished, and
waited.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hold them while I sign," whispered von Reiter. He
signed both orders.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg&nbsp;323]</span>
"Take them now. I shall not need the car. I shall
be here a long time&mdash;a&mdash;long&mdash;time. I am ill. So inform
headquarters by telegraph."</p>

<p class="indent">"At orders, Excellence."</p>

<p class="indent">Von Reiter closed his eyes: "Say to the Comte
d&#39;Yvoir that it was&mdash;bad luck&mdash;very bad luck....
But not&mdash;his fault.... Tell him I am&mdash;contented&mdash;that
a Gueldres is to marry my&mdash;daughter."</p>

<p class="indent">The aide saluted. But the sick man said nothing
more.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Von Reiter was still unconscious when Guild returned
from the forest.</p>

<p class="indent">Karen met him on the steps; he drew her aside:</p>

<p class="indent">"Dear," he whispered, "there has been more violence
during my absence. The Lesse men caught a traitor&mdash;a
wretched charcoal burner from Moresnet&mdash;prowling
about their camp.</p>

<p class="indent">"They hung him with his own belt. I saw him hanging
to a beech-tree.</p>

<p class="indent">"Darrel was greatly worried when I told him that the
Courlands had been forced to continue on to Luxembourg
City. He has gone to the hamlet of Croix to hire
a peasant to drive him after them and try to overtake
them.</p>

<p class="indent">"As for the others, they will not come to Antwerp with
me now. They have seen &#39;red&#39; again; and in spite of
all I could do they have started back toward Lesse to
&#39;drive&#39; Uhlans as they saw the wild game driven."</p>

<p class="indent">The girl shivered.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[pg&nbsp;324]</span>
Guild made a hopeless gesture: "It means the death
of every man among them. The Uhlans will do the
hunting and the driving, not the poor, half-crazed peasants....
It means the end of Lesse and of every man
who had ever called it home."</p>

<p class="indent">The hussar appeared at the door. Guild looked up,
returned the precise salute, and his careworn features
softened as he listened to the instructions and the parting
message from the now unconscious officer above.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a silence, then:</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen," he said quietly, "are you ready?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">The hussar asked whether there was luggage, and
learning that there was he sent the chauffeur in to bring
out Guild&#39;s box and Karen&#39;s suit-case and satchel.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl ran upstairs to the sick room. They admitted
her.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild was standing by the car when she returned, a
drooping, listless figure, her handkerchief pressed to her
face. He gave her his arm and aided her into the car.
The hussar stepped in beside the chauffeur.</p>

<p class="indent">Dawn was just breaking behind the house; the evergreens
stood out, massive and black against the silvering
east.</p>

<p class="indent">As the car moved slowly out of the gravel circle the
first bird twittered.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild bent over the girl beside him: "Is he still
unconscious?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is there any chance?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[pg&nbsp;325]</span>
"They don&#39;t know. It is the lungs. His body is all
crushed in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">She rested her cheek against his shoulder, weeping,
as the great grey car rushed on through the pallour
of early dawn.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>[pg&nbsp;326]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>WHO GOES THERE!</h3>

<p class="indent">Stretched out flat on the seat of a railway carriage,
her tear-marred face buried in her arms,
her dishevelled hair tumbled around her neck and
shoulders, Karen lay asleep. In that car all the other
compartments seemed to be full of Saxon reserve artillery
officers, their knobbed helmets shrouded in new grey
slips, their new, unwrinkled uniforms suggestive of a
very recent importation from across the Rhine.</p>

<p class="indent">Ahead, cattle cars, ore cars, and flat cars composed
the long train, the former filled with battery horses and
cannoniers, the latter loaded with guns, caissons, battery
waggons, forges, and camp equipment, all in brand-new
grey paint.</p>

<p class="indent">Except when the train stopped at some heavily
guarded station, nobody came to their compartment.
But at all stations officers opened the doors and silently
examined Guild&#39;s credentials&mdash;energetic, quick-moving,
but civil men, who, when the credentials proved acceptable,
invariably saluted his uniform with a correctness
impeccable.</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless, before the train moved out again, always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[pg&nbsp;327]</span>
there was a group of officers gazing in polite perplexity
at the green jacket and forage cap and the
cherry-coloured riding breeches of a regiment which,
they were perfectly aware, was already in the saddle
against them.</p>

<p class="indent">At one station Guild was able to buy bread and cheese
and fruit. But Karen still slept profoundly, and he did
not care to awaken her.</p>

<p class="indent">From the car windows none of the tragic traces of
war were visible except only the usual clusters of spiked
helmets along the line; the inevitable Uhlans riding
amid the landscape; slowly moving waggon-trains pursuing
roads parallel to the railway; brief glimpses of
troops encamped in fields. But nothing of the ravage
and desolation which blackened the land farther south
was apparent.</p>

<p class="indent">In the latitude of Liège, however, Guild could see
from the car windows the occasional remains of ruined
bridges damming small streams; and here and there
roofless and smoke-stained walls, or the blackened debris
of some burnt farm or factory or mill.</p>

<p class="indent">But the northern Ardennes did not appear to have
suffered very much from invasion as far as he could
make out; and whether the region was heavily occupied
by an invading army he could not determine from the
glimpses he obtained out of the car windows.</p>

<p class="indent">The line, however, was vigilantly guarded; that he
could see plainly enough; but the sky-line of the low
rolling country on either side might be the limits of
German occupation for all he could determine.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>[pg&nbsp;328]</span>
Two nights&#39; constant wakefulness had made him very
sleepy. He drowsed and nodded in his corner by the
shaking window, rousing himself at intervals to cast a
watchful glance at Karen.</p>

<p class="indent">She still slept like a worn-out child.</p>

<p class="indent">In the west the sun was already level with the car
windows&mdash;a cherry-hued ball veiled slightly in delicate
brown haze. The train had stopped at a siding in a
young woodland. He opened the window to the fresh,
sweet air and looked out at the yellowing autumn leaves
which the setting sun made transparent gold.</p>

<p class="indent">It was very still; scarcely a sound except from very
high in the air somewhere came a faint clattering noise.
And after a while he turned his head and looked up at
a flight of aeroplanes crossing the line at an immense
height.</p>

<p class="indent">Stately, impressive, like a migration of wide-winged
hawks, they glided westward, the red sun touching their
undersides with rose. And he watched them until
they became dots, and disappeared one by one in mid-heaven.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently, along the main track, came rushing a hospital
train, the carriages succeeding one another like
flashes of light, vanishing into perspective with a diminishing
roar and leaving in its wake an odour of disinfectants.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the train he was on began to move; soldiers
along the rails stood at attention; a company of Uhlans
cantered along a parallel road, keeping pace with the
cars for a while. Then the woods closed in again, thick,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>[pg&nbsp;329]</span>
shaggy forest land which blotted out the low-hanging
sun.</p>

<p class="indent">He closed the window, turned and glanced at Karen.
She slept. And he lay back in his corner and closed
his haggard eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">The next time he opened them the light in the car
had become very dim.</p>

<p class="indent">Twilight purpled the woods and hills; dusk was arriving
swiftly.</p>

<p class="indent">It was dark when, at a way station, a soldier opened
the door, saluted, and lighted the lamp in the compartment.
The train lay there a long while; they were
unloading horses, cannon and waggons; teams were
being harnessed in the dark, guns limbered, cannoniers
mounted, all in perfect order and with a quiet celerity
and an absence of noise and confusion that fascinated
Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently, and within a space of time almost incredible,
the artillery moved off into the darkness. He could
hear the rhythmical trample of horses, the crunch of
wheels, sabres rattling, the subdued clank and clatter
of a field battery on the march. But he could see no
lights, distinguish no loud voices, no bugle-calls. Now
and then a clear whistle note sounded; now and then
a horse snorted, excited by the open air.</p>

<p class="indent">The car in which they were was now detached and
sidetracked; the long train backed slowly past and away
into the darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">And after a while another locomotive came steaming
out of the obscurity ahead; he heard them coupling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>[pg&nbsp;330]</span>
it to the car in which he sat. The jar did not awaken
Karen.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently they were in motion again; the tiled roof
of an unlighted railway station glided past the window;
stars appeared, trees, a high dark hill to the
right.</p>

<p class="indent">A military guard came through the corridor, lantern
in hand, and told Guild that the car was now
entirely empty and at his disposal.</p>

<p class="indent">So he rose and went forward where he could look
out ahead and see the dull glow of the smokestack and
the ruddy light of the furnace.</p>

<p class="indent">For a long while he stood there watching the moving
silhouettes of engineer and fireman. The sombre
red light trembled on the rails and swept the wayside
trees or painted with fiery streaks the sides of a cut
or glittered along the rocky wet walls of tunnels.</p>

<p class="indent">When at last he went back to the compartment,
Karen was sitting up, twisting her hair into shape.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you feel rested?" he asked cheerfully, seating
himself beside her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, thank you. Where are we, Kervyn?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know."</p>

<p class="indent">She was still busy with her hair, but her eyes remained
on him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Can I do anything for you? Do you need anything?"
he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"I seem to need almost everything!" she protested,
"including a bath and a clergyman. Oh, Kervyn, <i>what</i>
a wedding journey! Is there anything about me that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>[pg&nbsp;331]</span>
resembles a bride? And I&#39;m not even that, yet&mdash;just
a crumpled, soiled, disreputable child!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You are absolutely adorable just as you are!"</p>

<p class="indent">"No! I am unspeakable. And I want to be attractive
to you. I really can be very nice-looking, only
you never saw me so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Dearest!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I haven&#39;t had any clothes since I first met you!" she
said excitedly. "You know I can scarcely bear it to
have you think of me this way. Will I have time to
buy a gown in Antwerp? How long will it take us to
marry each other? Because, of course, I shall not
let you ride away with your regiment until you are my
husband."</p>

<p class="indent">She flushed again, and the tears sprang to her eyes.
It was plain that her nerves had given way under the
long strain.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kervyn! Only yesterday war meant almost nothing
to me. And look at me now!&mdash;look at the girl you saw
in England only a few days ago!&mdash;a woman today!&mdash;a
wife tomorrow, please God&mdash;and the fear of this
war already overwhelming me."</p>

<p class="indent">She brushed the starting tears from her eyes; they
filled again. She said miserably: "We women all inherit
sorrow, it seems, the moment our girlhood leaves
us. A few days ago I didn&#39;t know what it was to be
afraid. Then you came. And with you came friendship.
And with friendship came fear&mdash;fear for <i>you</i>!...
And then, very swiftly, love came; and my girlhood
was gone&mdash;gone&mdash;like yesterday&mdash;leaving me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>[pg&nbsp;332]</span>
alone in the world with you and love and war!"</p>

<p class="indent">He drew her face against his shoulder:</p>

<p class="indent">"This world war is making us all feel a little lonely,"
he said. "The old familiar world is already changing
under our bewildered eyes. It is a totally new era
which is dawning; a new people is replacing the inhabitants
of earth, born to new thoughts, new ideals,
new ambitions.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think the old tyranny is already beginning to pass
from men&#39;s souls and minds; the old folk-ways, the old
and out-worn terrors, the tinselled dogmas, the old false
standards, the universal dread of that absolute intellectual
freedom which alone can make a truly new heaven
and a new earth.</p>

<p class="indent">"All this is already beginning to pass away in the
awful intellectual revelation which this world war is
making hour by hour.</p>

<p class="indent">"What wonder that we feel the approaching change,
the apprehension of that mortal loneliness which must
leave us stripped of all that was familiar while the old
order passes&mdash;vanishes like mist at dawn."</p>

<p class="indent">He bent and touched her hand with his lips:</p>

<p class="indent">"But there will be a dawn, Karen. Never doubt it,
sweet!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Shall our children see it&mdash;if God is kind to us?" she
whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. If God is very kind, I think that we shall see
it, too."</p>

<p class="indent">The girl nodded, pressing her cheek against his, her
eyes clear and sweetly grave.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>[pg&nbsp;333]</span>
He said: "No man ever born, since Christ, has dared
to be himself. No woman, either.... I think our
children will begin to dare."</p>

<p class="indent">She mused, wide-eyed, wondering.</p>

<p class="indent">"And he who takes up a sword," he said in a low
voice, "shall find himself alone like a mad dog in a city
street, with every living soul bent upon his extermination.</p>

<p class="indent">"Thus will perish emperors and kings. Our children&#39;s
children shall have heard of them, marvelling that
we had lived to see them pass away into the mist of
fable."</p>

<p class="indent">After a while she lifted her face and looked at him
out of wistful eyes:</p>

<p class="indent">"Meanwhile <i>you</i> fight for them," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am of today&mdash;a part of the mock mystery and
the tarnished tinsel. That grey old man of Austria
quarrels with his neighbour of Servia, and calls out
four million men to do his murders for him. And an
Emperor in white and steel buckles on his winged helmet
summons six million more in the name of God.</p>

<p class="indent">"That is a tragedy called &#39;Today.&#39; But it is the last
act, Karen. Already while we hold the stage the scene
shifters are preparing the drama called &#39;Tomorrow.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">"Already the last cues are being given; already the
company that held the stage is moving slowly toward
the eternal wings. The stage is to be swept clean;
everything must go, toy swords and cannon, crowns
and ermine, the old and battered property god who
required a sea of blood and tears to propitiate him; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>[pg&nbsp;334]</span>
old and false idol once worshiped as Honour, and set
upon a pedestal of dead bones. All these must go,
Karen&mdash;are already going.... But&mdash;I am in the cast
of &#39;Today&#39;; I may only watch them pass, and play my
part until the curtain falls."</p>

<p class="indent">They remained silent for a long time. The train had
been running very slowly. Presently it stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">Guild rose and went to the door of the compartment,
where a lantern glimmered, held high. Soldiers opened
the door; an officer of Guard Cuirassiers saluted.</p>

<p class="indent">"We control the line no farther," he said. "Telegraphic
orders direct me to send you forward with a
flag."</p>

<p class="indent">"May I ask where we are?" said Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not far from Antwerp. Will you aid Madam to
descend? Time presses. We have a motor car at your
disposal."</p>

<p class="indent">He turned, aided Karen to the wooden platform,
which was thronged with heavy cavalrymen, then lifted
out their luggage, which a soldier in fatigue cap took.</p>

<p class="indent">"There was also a box," said Guild to the officer of
Cuirassiers.</p>

<p class="indent">"It is already in the tonneau." He drew a telegram
from his pocket and handed it to Guild, and the young
man read it under the flickering lantern light:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Captain the Comte d&#39;Yvoir</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">I am told that I shall recover. It has been, so
far, between us, only the sword; but I trust, one
day, it shall be the hand. Luck was against me.
Not your fault.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>[pg&nbsp;335]</span>
I send to you and to my daughter my respect
and my good will. Until a more auspicious day,
then, and without rancour.</p>

<p class="center">Your friend the enemy,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Von Reiter</span>, Maj.-Gen&#39;l.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Karen, reading over his shoulder, pressed his arm
convulsively. Tears filled her eyes, but she was smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">"May we send a wire?" asked Guild of the officer.</p>

<p class="indent">An orderly came with pencil and telegraph blank.
Guild wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">We are happy to learn that you are to recover.
Gratitude, respect, salute from me; from her,
gratitude and love. It will always be the hand.
May the auspicious day come quickly.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The orderly took the blank; Guild returned the salute
of the Cuirassier and followed the soldier who was
carrying their luggage.</p>

<p class="indent">An automobile stood there, garnished with two white
lanterns and a pair of white flags.</p>

<p class="indent">A moment later they were speeding through the darkness
out across a vast dim plain.</p>

<p class="indent">An officer sat in the front seat beside a military
chauffeur; behind them, on a rumble, was seated a cavalryman.</p>

<p class="indent">In a few minutes the first challenge came; they
stopped; helmeted figures clustered around them, a few
words were whispered, then on they rolled, slowly, until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>[pg&nbsp;336]</span>
there came another challenge, another delay; and others
followed in succession as the tall phantoms of Uhlans
loomed up around them in the night.</p>

<p class="indent">Two of these lancers wheeled and accompanied the
automobile at a canter. One of the riders was a trumpeter;
and very soon the car halted and the Uhlan set
his trumpet to his lips and sounded it.</p>

<p class="indent">Almost immediately a distant bugle answered. The
cavalryman on the rumble stood up, hung one of the
lanterns to a white flag, and waved it slowly to and fro.
Then the mounted Uhlan tied the flag to his lance-tip,
hung the lantern to it, and raised it high in the air.
Already the chauffeur had piled their luggage by the
roadside; the officer got out, came around, and opened
the door. As Karen descended he gave her his arm,
then saluted and sprang to his place. The car backed
in a half circle, turned, backed again, swung clear
around, and went humming away into the darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">From the shadowy obscurity ahead came the trample
of horses.</p>

<p class="indent">"Halt! Who goes there?" cried the mounted lancer.</p>

<p class="indent">"Parlementaire with a flag!"</p>

<p class="indent">The Uhlan trumpeter sounded the parley again,
then, reversing his trumpet, reined in and sat like a
statue, as half a dozen cloaked riders walked their
horses up under the rays of the lantern which dangled
from the Uhlan&#39;s lifted lance.</p>

<p class="indent">A cavalryman wearing a jaunty Belgian forage cap
leaned from his saddle and looked earnestly at Guild.</p>

<p class="indent">"Who is this, if you please?" he asked curiously.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>[pg&nbsp;337]</span>
"Reserve cavalry officer and his wife," said the Uhlan
crisply. "Orders are to deliver them to you."</p>

<p class="indent">The Belgian lieutenant had already recognized the
uniform of the Guides; so had the other cavalrymen;
and now they were hastily dismounting and leading
their horses forward.</p>

<p class="indent">"Karen," said Guild unsteadily, "it&#39;s my own regiment!"
And he stepped forward and took the lieutenant&#39;s
hands in both of his. His features were working; he
could not speak, but the troopers seemed to understand.</p>

<p class="indent">They gave Karen a horse; Guild lifted her to the
saddle, shortened the stirrup, and set her sideways.</p>

<p class="indent">They offered him another horse, but he shook his
head, flung one arm over Karen&#39;s saddle and walked
on slowly beside her stirrup.</p>

<p class="indent">Behind them the clatter of retreating hoofs marked
the return of the Uhlans. From somewhere in the darkness
a farm cart rumbled up and cavalrymen lifted in
their luggage.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, under the clustered planets the cart and the
troopers moved off over a wide, smooth road across
the plain.</p>

<p class="indent">And last of all came Karen with Guild on foot beside
her.</p>

<p class="caption">"And last of all came Karen with Guild on foot beside her"</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Her horse stepped slowly, cautiously; her slim hand
lay on her lover&#39;s shoulder, his arm was around her,
and his cheek rested against her knees.</p>

<p class="indent">All the world was before them now, with all that it
can ever hold for the sons of men&mdash;the eternal trinity,
inexorable, unchangeable&mdash;Death, and Life, and Love.</p>
